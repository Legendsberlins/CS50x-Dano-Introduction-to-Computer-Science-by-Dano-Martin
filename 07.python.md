# Python

# Comparison with C

As computers have become faster and have more space, there are more modern languages with more human oriented syntax than C. One of those languages is python.

To print `hello, world` in python, the code will look like👇🏾:

```python
print("Hello, world")
```

In order to run code in python, you also don’t have to compile but will have to run an interpreter👇🏾:

```bash
$ python filename.py
```

To import libraries, python does not use the `#include` syntax but👇🏾:

```python
import cs50
```

Specific functions can also be imported from a library👇🏾:

```python
from cs50 import get_string
```

There are two ways to import multiple functions from a library (single or multi lines)👇🏾:

```python
from cs50 import get_float, get_int, get_string
```

```python
from cs50 import get_float
from cs50 import get_int
from cs50 import get_string
```

To ask for a string, you can import the `get_string` function from cs50👇🏾:

```python
from cs50 import get_string
answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
print("Hello, " + answer)
```

This can also be done with a comma👇🏾:

```python
from cs50 import get_string
answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
print("Hello,",answer)
```

A third way of doing this is👇🏾:

```python
from cs50 import get_string
answer = get_string("What's your first name? ")
print(f"Hello, {answer}")
```

Python also doesn’t have the `main` function. The interpreter runs whatever code is indented to the left.

## Object Oriented Programming

Python uses object oriented programming unlike C which uses procedural programming. Object oriented programming is a technique where by certain values like a string not only have properties inside them but can have methods built into them.

C uses structs which can only store data (name, number). In python, you cannot only have a struct (class) storing a name/number but you can also have a method to call that person or email that person or actual verbs or actions associated with that piece of data. So to access a method inside a data(variable) you can use syntax like👇🏾:

```python
variableName.method()
```

# Datatypes and features

## Datatypes

Python has four datatypes: int, str, bool, float. It doesn’t use long, double like in C because python itself solves what those datatypes solve as it uses more bits. Therefore, int and float use more bits and can cover a larger variety of numbers than in C.

## Features

Python has different features like tuples, list, range, dict, set.

**List** replaces arrays in C.

**Tuple** is like x and y pairs.

**Dict** is a dictionary data structure.

**Set** is a collection of values which gets rid of duplicates.

## Speller

In python, if you want a hash table you just need to call a `dict()` function and give it a variable👇🏾:

```python
words = dict()
```

Also, when defining new functions you can write it this way👇🏾:

```python
def check(word):
```

To implement our speller problem (from the previous problem set in C) in python, the code will be👇🏾:

```python
#Make a hash table
words = set()

#Create function check which checks if word is in set
def check(word):
    #Convert words in uppercase to lowercase
    if word.lower() in words:
        return True
    else:
        return False

#Function dictionary which reads file
def load(dictionary):
    file = open(dictionary, "r")
    for line in file:
        #line.rstrip gets rid of the \n
        word = line.rstrip()
        #add words variable to that line
        words.add(word)
    close(file)
    return True

#function size to determine the length(number) of words
def size():
    return len(words)

#function unload to free space(no malloc or free in python)
def unload():
    return True
```

**N/B:** C loads faster than python even if python has less lines of code due to a C programmer controlling the space in memory.

# Operators

**Arithmetic operators** are used to perform mathematical operations. We have different arithmetic operators in python 👇🏾:

| Operator | Name | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | x + y |
| - | Subtraction | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | x * y |
| / | Division | x / y |
| % | Modulus | x % y |
| ** | Exponentiation | x ** y |
| // | Floor division | x//y |

# Conditionals

To demonstrate one condition in python 👇🏾:

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
```

To demonstrate two conditions👇🏾:

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("y is less than x")
```

To demonstrate more than two conditions,  use `elif` to replace `else`👇🏾:

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("y is less than x")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
```

# Variables

To declare a variable in python, you don’t need to include its datatype like in C and you also don’t end it with a semicolon👇🏾:

```python
counter = 0
```

There are two ways to increment a variable in python👇🏾:

```python
counter = counter + 1
```

```python
counter += 1
```

***Notice, the `counter++;` option of C doesn’t transcend to python.**

# Loops

There are two types of loop in python (while and for loops)👇🏾:

## While loop

```python
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("Meow")
    i += 1
```

## For loop

```python
for i in [0, 1, 2]:
    print("Meow")
```

In case of large output in for loops, you can use a function called `range`👇🏾:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print("Meow")
```

You can also increment through for loops by numbers greater than one by including two more arguments in the range function (a start number, a stop number, how much we want to increment by). Example👇🏾:

```python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
		print(i)
```

This will return integers starting from 0 but counting till 10. Therefore, it will output👇🏾:

```bash
0
2
4
6
8
```

## Infinite Loop

**Infinite loops** in python return the output an infinite number of time.

```python
while True:
    print("Meow")
```

**N/B**: Booleans (true and false) have their first letters capitalized in python.

# Python Programs

## Calculator

You can create a simple calculator in python which gives the user a chance to input two numbers and outputs the sum of those numbers.

```python
from cs50 import get_int

firstNumber = get_int("X: ")
secondNumber = get_int("Y: ")

print(firstNumber + secondNumber)
```

You can also replace cs50’s `get_int` with a python inbuilt function called `input` which does the same thing (asks the user to input data). The `input` function though, reads text therefore the code below will just concatenate the two variables e.g. `firstNumber(2`) + `secondNumber(3)` = 23👇🏾:

```python
firstNumber = input("X: ")
secondNumber = input("Y: ")
print(firstNumber + secondNumber)
```

You can fix this by **casting (specifying the type of the variable).** 

```python
firstNumber = int(input("X: "))
secondNumber = int(input("Y: "))
print(firstNumber + secondNumber)
```

Python automatically fixes the problem of **truncation (rounding off the result of two integers when it should be a float)** for us👇🏾:

```python
firstNumber = int(input("X: "))
secondNumber = int(input("Y: "))
result = firstNumber/secondNumber
print(result)
```

You can fix **floating point overflow** in python by using an `fstring` which gives you the opportunity to format a string precisely👇🏾:

```python
firstNumber = int(input("X: "))
secondNumber = int(input("Y: "))
result = firstNumber/secondNumber
print(f"{result:.10f}")
```

If you use too many decimal places, you may have **a floating point imprecision problem (is where the computer isn’t very precise due to it’s finite number of bits).** This can be fixed using third party libraries.

Python also fixes **integer overflow(a situation where you want to use more bits than the system can produce)** problem. Whatever math you input will output correctly but it can limit the number of digits that will be shown on the screen.

## Compare

To ask the user for integer inputs and then compare both values 👇🏾:

```python
x = input("X: ")
y = input("Y: ")

if x > y:
    print("X is greater than Y")
elif x < y:
    print("Y is greater than X")
else:
    print("X and Y are equal")
```

```python
x = input("X: ")
y = input("Y: ")

if x > y:
    print(x,"is greater than",y)
elif x < y:
    print(y,"is greater than",x)
else:
    print(x,"and",y,"are equal")
```

## Agree

In the code below, we prompted the user to choose `Y or y` to agree, `N or n` to disagree which means if the user chooses any other character, an error message will be displayed👇🏾:

```python
choose = input("Do you agree? ")

if choose == 'Y' or choose == 'y':
    print("Agreed")
elif choose == 'N' or choose == 'n':
    print("Disagreed")
else:
    print("Error")
```

**N/B**: In python, you can use double quotes (“”) or single quotes (‘’) to display a `string` as it doesn’t have a `char` datatype. 

**N/B:** In python, OR is written as `or` and AND is written as `and` .

You can also use lists to implement this👇🏾:

```python
choose = input("Do you agree? ")

if choose in ['Y','y']:
    print("Agreed")
elif choose in ['N','n']:
    print("Disagreed")
else:
    print("Error")
```

You can also improve this code using the method `lower()`👇🏾:

```python
choose = input("Do you agree? ")

if choose.lower() in ['y','yes']:
    print("Agreed")
elif choose.lower() in ['n','no']:
    print("Disagreed")
else:
    print("Error")
```

You can improve the design by changing the value of `choose` to avoid repeating the class `.lower()`. This gets rid of the users original input though👇🏾:

```python
choose = input("Do you agree? ")
choose = choose.lower()

if choose in ['y','yes']:
    print("Agreed")
elif choose in ['n','no']:
    print("Disagreed")
else:
    print("Error")
```

## Mario

### Height

Python doesn’t make use of do while loops like C, therefore in order to ask the user for an input till the user cooperates by filling in the right detail, you can write a code like👇🏾:

```python
while True:
    height = int(input("Height: "))
    if height > 0:
        break
```

You can use this to print `#` based on the height the user inputs👇🏾:

```python
while True:
    height = int(input("Height: "))
    if height > 0:
        break

for i in range(height):
    print("#")
```

You can also solve this by creating a function. In this case, `get_height`👇🏾:

```python
def main():
    h = get_height()

    for i in range(h):
        print("#")

def get_height():
    while True:
        height = int(input("Height: "))
        if height > 0:
            break
    return height

main()
```

`break` can be interchanged with `return`👇🏾:

```python
def main():
    h = get_height()

    for i in range(h):
        print("#")

def get_height():
    while True:
        height = int(input("Height: "))
        if height > 0:
            return height

main()
```

Using the `input` function ahead of cs50s `get_int` with the `int` datatype will actually give an error message without prompting again if the user types in a string or another datatype. It can be fixed by using a `try` function which tries to convert a `string` to an `int`, tries to check if it’s greater than 0 (in this case ) and an `except` function which tells us that if a `ValueError` occurs, we should print an error message and prompt the user again with the loop👇🏾:

```python
def main():
    h = get_height()

    for i in range(h):
        print("#")

def get_height():
    while True:
        try:
            height = int(input("Height: "))
            if height > 0:
                return height
        except ValueError:
            print("Not an integer")

main()
```

You can also simply use the cs50 `get_int` function to avoid this.

It can also be written like👇🏾:

```python
def main():
    h = get_height()

    for i in range(h):
        print("#")

def get_height():
    while True:
        try:
            height = int(input("Height: "))
        except ValueError:
            print("Not an integer")
        else:
            if height > 0:
                return height

main()
```

### Width

If you want to get rid of the automatic new line in python, you can do this with an `end` keyword. In the python documentation, there’s an automatic `end = “\n”` that prompts our terminal to the next line. So, to get rid of it, you use `end = “”`.

```python
def main():
    w = get_width()

    for i in range(w):
        print("#", end = " ")
    print()

def get_width():
    while True:
        try:
            width = int(input("Width: "))
        except ValueError:
            print("Not an integer")
        else:
            if width > 0:
                return width

main()
```

This `end = “”` is called **a named argument.** 

### Rows and columns

In python, you can also use operators to print👇🏾:

```python
for i in range (4):
    print("#" * 3)
```

This outputs👇🏾:

```bash
###
###
###
###
```

Another way to print rows and columns is👇🏾:

```python
for i in range (4):
    for j in range(5):
        print("#", end = "")
    print()
```

## Uppercase conversion

In order to convert a word from lower to uppercase in python👇🏾:

```python
before = input("Before: ")
print("After: ", end = "")
for c in before:
    print(c.upper(), end = "")
print()
```

This outputs👇🏾:

```bash
Before: hello
After: HELLO
```

You can also do this in fewer lines of code not having to operate on characters individually👇🏾:

```python
before = input("Before: ")
after = before.upper()
print("After:",after)
```

## Swap

To swap in python, you can easily use the syntax `variable1,variable2 = variable2,variable1`👇🏾:

```python
x = 1
y = 2
print("X is",x, "and Y is",y)
x , y = y , x
print("X is",x, "and Y is",y)
```

## CSV file (Comma-Separated Values)

In python, you can also open an external file. In the code below, we opened the file `phonebook.csv` and created a writer variable basically telling python to treat the file like a csv file. As the user inputs his details, it appends into the csv file.

```python
import csv

file = open("phonebook.csv", "a")

name = input("Name: ")
number = input("Number: ")

#Like saying python should treat this file like a csv file
writer = csv.writer(file)
writer.writerow([name, number])

file.close()
```

You can use the syntax below to avoid closing the file👇🏾:

```python
import csv

with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:

    name = input("Name: ")
    number = input("Number: ")

    #Like saying python should treat this file like a csv file
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([name, number])
```

You can also use a `.Dictwriter` function to write it in a dictionary format👇🏾:

```python
import csv

file = open("phonebook.csv", "a")

name = input("Name: ")
number = input("Number: ")

#Like saying python should treat this file like a csv file
writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames = ["name","number"])
writer.writerow({"name": name, "number":number})

file.close()
```

In the example below, we read from the csv file phonebook.csv👇🏾:

```python
import csv

with open("phonebook.csv") as file:
    text = file.read()

    print(text) #if we also want to print the file content
```

In the example below, we opened phonebook.csv and read through it in a `dict` format using the `csv.DictReader` function. We then created a loop called `name` which appends everything in the phonebook.csv file into the list called `list`. We then printed out all the names in the `dict`.

```python
import csv

list = []
with open("phonebook.csv") as file:
    file_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for name in file_reader:
        list.append(name)

for name in list:
    print(name["name"])
```

**N/B:** There’s also a `DictReader` function which reads a csv file in a `dict` format.

## Dictionary

A **dictionary** implements a two column table of a key and a value. These keys points to the values.

![Screenshot (108).png](Screenshot_(108).png)

In python, you can create an empty dictionary that gives you the key-value table using two methods👇🏾:

```python
people = dict()
```

```python
people = {}
```

***A `set()` is only sufficient when you want only one of the keys or values.**

You can write a code that stores names and numbers in a `dict` and can print out a persons other information, in this case `number` using `dict[variable prompted]` syntax👇🏾:

```python
dict = {
    "Kailash": "+91-7283-019348",
    "Priya": "+91-8347-231349",
    "Karthik": "+91-0930-284758"
}

name = input("Name: ")
if name in dict:
    number = dict[name]
    print("Number:",number)
else:
    print("Not Found")
```

You can also index the exact name you want to be outputted. The example below will only ever output Kailash’s number👇🏾:

```python
dict = {
    "Kailash": "+91-7283-019348",
    "Priya": "+91-8347-231349",
    "Karthik": "+91-0930-284758"
}

name = input("Name: ")
if name in dict:
    number = dict["Kailash"]
    print("Number:",number)
else:
    print("Not Found")
```

### Printing keys and values

You can also put items in a `dict`. In this case, title and author are the keys with Corduroy and Don Freeman as their values. `print(book[”title”])` prompts Corduroy👇🏾:

![Screenshot (111).png](Screenshot_(111).png)

You can combine a list and a dict by creating both and then appending the contents of the dict into the list. The example below creates a list and a dict called `book` then prompts the user for the title and author of the book in the dict before appending what the user inputs into the list and printing the list 👇🏾:

```python
list = []

for i in range(3):
    book = dict()
    book["title"] = input("Title: ").capitalize() #capitalizes the users input
    book["author"] = input("Author: ").capitalize() #capitalizes the users input

    list.append(book)
print(list)
```

In the example below, we created a dict of NBA teams and we used the variable `i` to iterate and print the keys. We also used the variable `position` to print the values of those keys👇🏾:

```python
teams = {
    "Golden State Warriors": 1,
    "Lakers": 2,
    "Celtics": 3,
    "Phoenix suns": 4
}
for i in teams:
    print(i)
for i, position in teams.items():
    print(position)
for i, position in teams.items():
    print(i,"is ranked",position)
```

This outputs👇🏾:

```python
Golden State Warriors
Lakers
Celtics
Phoenix suns
1
2
3
4
Goldern State warriors is ranked 1
Lakers is ranked 2
Celtics is ranked 3
Phoenix suns is ranked 4
```

## Lists

**Lists** replace arrays in Python except that you don’t have to manage the memory of list. The length of a list can be checked using the function `len`. 

You can create a list in two ways👇🏾:

```python
mylist = []
```

```python
mylist = list()
```

To find the average of scores in a list, you can make use of `sum` function and `len` function👇🏾:

```python
scores = [80, 60, 100]

average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
print("Average:",average)
```

You can use the `.append()` method to add a users input to a list👇🏾:

```python
from cs50 import get_int

scores = []
for i in range(3):
    score = get_int("Score: ")
    scores.append(score)
    
average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
print("AVERAGE:",average)
```

This can also be done by concatenating the list in order to append👇🏾:

```python
from cs50 import get_int

scores = []
for i in range(3):
    score = get_int("Score: ")
    scores = scores + [score]

average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
print("AVERAGE:",average)
```

You can also make a loop inside a list 👇🏾:

```python
list = [x for x in range(100)]
print(list)
```

The example below makes use of the `.insert()` method to append 100 at the 100th index (after range 0-99)👇🏾:

```python
list = [x for x in range(100)]
print(list)
list.insert(100,100)
print(list)
```

This can also be done by slicing. Here, we use the `len` function to go to the end of the list and include `[100]` at the end👇🏾:

```python
list = [x for x in range(100)]
print(list)
list[len(list):] = [100]
print(list)
```

## Speech and QR code

The code below imports a library and creates a variable `engine` which initializes that library. The user then inputs his name and the `engine.say` calls `hello + <name>`. `engine.runAndWait()` just lets the speech recognition run👇🏾:

![Screenshot (109).png](Screenshot_(109).png)

The code below is a QR code which links the user to a YouTube video👇🏾:

![Screenshot (110).png](Screenshot_(110).png)

# Building a function

In python, to build a function you begin with `def` which means define a function. Functions are also read from top to bottom, this means if our function is below the main code, it wouldn’t run.

```python
def meow():
    for i in range (3):
        print("Meow")

meow()
```

If you want your `meow` function to be written below the code, you can define `main` function to your main code. You will also have to call `main()` as the very last line of your program👇🏾:

```python
def main():
    meow()

def meow():
    for i in range (3):
        print("Meow")

main()
```

`meow()` can also have an argument

```python
def main():
    meow(3)

def meow(n):
    for i in range (n):
        print("Meow")

main()
```

# Command Line Arguments

You can implement Command Line Arguments in python from the sys library;

```python
from sys import argv
```

```python
from sys import argv
if len(argv) == 2:
    print("Hello",argv[1])
else:
    print("Hello, world")
```

When you prompt👇🏾:

```bash
$ python hello.py
```

To print out all command line arguments, you can use two ways👇🏾:

```python
from sys import argv

for i in range(len(argv)):
    print(argv[i])
```

```python
from sys import argv

for arg in argv:
    print(arg)
```

You can also **slice** off the first command line argument by selecting where you want `argv` to be iterated from👇🏾:

```python
from sys import argv

for arg in argv[1:]:
    print(arg)
```

Slicing can also include an end value👇🏾:

```python
from sys import argv

for arg in argv[1:2]:
    print(arg)
```

## Libraries

You can import a library as a whole but you will have to use `library.function()` syntax when looking for functions in that library👇🏾:

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Missing command line argument")
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print("Hello",sys.argv[1])
    sys.exit(0)
```

# Linear search

You can implement linear search in python. In the example below, if the user types a name on the list, it will prompt a `Found` text, if the name isn’t on the list, it will prompt a `Not found` text👇🏾:

```python
import sys

names = ["Priya", "Kailash", "Karthik", "Koumar"]

name = input("Name: ")
for n in names:
    if name == n:
        print("Found")
        sys.exit(0)
print("Not found")
sys.exit(1)
```

This code can be simplified👇🏾:

```python
import sys

names = ["Priya", "Kailash", "Karthik", "Koumar"]

name = input("Name: ")
if name in names:
    print("Found")
    sys.exit(0)
    
print("Not found")
sys.exit(1)
```
