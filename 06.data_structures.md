# Data Structures

# Intro

The term **data structure** in C basically involves how data is structured in memory using pointers.

# Abstract Data Types

**Abstract data types** have some properties but it can have underlying implementations which are created by the programmer (based on how the programmer wants to implement it).

## Queue

A **queue** is a type of data structure which uses a FIFO (First in First out) property.

It consists of 2 functions/operations:

- **Enqueue:** adding data to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue:** removing the first data in the queue.

## Stack

A **stack** is another abstract datatype where a new data is stacked above an old one. Imagine stacking trays above each other and asking the user to pick a tray, he/she will probably pick the highest tray or imagine how your notifications are stacked. Therefore, it uses a LIFO (Last in First Out) property.

Stack uses 2 operators:

- **Push:** basically adding an item to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** removing an item from the top of the stack

# Data Structure

```c
const int CAPACITY = 50;

typedef struct
{
    person people[CAPACITY];
    int size;
}
stack;

```

# Allocating a new array populated with larger items than the original

In a computers memory, there are a lot of things stored. So if we want to add another item to an array, we can easily compromise another data in the memory.

![Screenshot (70).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(70).png)

In order to increase the population of an array, we can use the initial array as a pointer to a new array and then assign the values of the new array to the initial array.

![Screenshot (69).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(69).png)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (list == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    list[0] = 10;
    list[1] = 15;
    list[2] = 20;

    int *tmp = malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
    if (tmp == NULL)
    {
        free(list);
        return 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
        tmp[i] = list[i];
    }
    tmp[3] = 4;

    free(list);

    list = tmp;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        printf("%i\n", list[i]);
    }

    free(list);
    return 0;
}
```

This can be simplified with the help of `realloc` function.

# `realloc`

`realloc` is a function used to re-allocate memory. It uses two Command Line Arguments (CLAs): the chunk of memory you want to update (grow or shrink) and what size you want. It automatically frees up your previous memory.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (list == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    list[0] = 10;
    list[1] = 15;
    list[2] = 20;

    int *tmp = realloc(list, 4 * sizeof(int));
    if (tmp == NULL)
    {
        free(list);
        return 1;
    }
    list = tmp;
    list[3] = 4;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        printf("%i\n", list[i]);
    }

    free(list);
    return 0;
}
```

# Linked lists

The term **linked lists** basically describes a way of linking different variables in different locations in memory using pointers.

![Screenshot (73).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(73).png)

![Screenshot (74).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(74).png)

![Screenshot (75).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(75).png)

Here, the variable assigning one is pointed to the address of the variable assigning 2 and the variable assigning 2 is pointed to the address of the variable assigning 3. The variable assigning 3 is pointed to a null value, meaning it does not have to do anything (invalid pointer). Pointer (0x123) then stores all the items.

These rectangles can be seen as **nodes** - ****a container in code for storing values.

To implement this in code👇🏾:

```c
typedef struct
{
    int number;
    node *next;
}
node;
```

`node *next` simply specifies the address of the next node. We can’t just use the datatype called node though as it’s not a traditional C datatype. We would have to declare the node datatype at the top. In that case👇🏾:

```c
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *next;
}
node;
```

![Screenshot (81).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(81).png)

This can be written in code as👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *next;
}
node;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    node *list = NULL;
    for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++)
    {
        int number = atoi(argv[i]);
        node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
        if (n == NULL)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        (*n).number = number;
        (*n).next = NULL; //n->next = NULL means the same thing;
        n->next = list;
        list = n;
    }
    node *ptr = list;
    while (ptr != NULL)
    {
        printf("%i\n", ptr->number);
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }
    ptr = list;
    while (ptr != NULL)
    {
        node *next = ptr->next;
        free(ptr);
        ptr = next;
    }

}
```

## Nodes

In the context of data structures like linked lists and trees, a **node** is an individual element that holds data and a reference (or references) to other nodes. In a linked list, a node typically contains a value and a pointer to the next node. In a tree, a node holds a value and references to its child nodes.

## Downsides of Linked lists

- It uses twice the space as it not just stores a variable but a pointer to it.
- You can’t index through the lists as they are located in different areas of the memory i.e. not contiguous.
- You can’t use binary search algorithm for link lists.

# Binary search trees

As said before, in an array you cannot add more items if there’s no space which is what linked lists does. But you can use pointers which serve as branches to do and also arrange the numbers sequentially👇🏾:

![Screenshot (82).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(82).png)

This gives that dynamism as you can append or prepend more items and it uses binary search as its searching algorithm. To implement this in code you can start with a struct👇🏾:

![Screenshot (83).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(83).png)

You can use recursion for this algorithm👇🏾:

![Screenshot (85).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(85).png)

## Disadvantages of the tree format

- It uses a lot of memory.
- There’s a bit of perversion in it i.e. it can turn into linked lists if not approached well.

# Dictionary, Hashing

A **dictionary** is another abstract datatype consisting of key-value pairs. Key is what you use to look for something and value is what you find via the key. E.g. in a phonebook, the key is the name and the value is the number.

![Screenshot (87).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(87).png)

## Hashing

**Hashing** requires taking as input some value and outputting a simpler version. Hashing combines an array(vertically) and linked lists (horizontally). Application of arrays and linked lists to leverage the best of both worlds to achieve a $O(1)$ algorithm.

![In this example, we take an input of about 52 cards and output it into a smaller range as we reduce them.](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(88).png)

In this example, we take an input of about 52 cards and output it into a smaller range as we reduce them.

## Hash function

A **hash function** an algorithm/math/code that implements the idea of hashing. The hash function is used to know where to output items in a hash table.

![Screenshot (105).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(105).png)

![We created a node array of the alphabets and run the function `hash` to show the corresponding alphabets of the indexes.](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(106).png)

We created a node array of the alphabets and run the function `hash` to show the corresponding alphabets of the indexes.

## Hash tables

A **hash table** is an array of linked lists.

You can find most of the names in constant time ($O(1)$). For most of the characters you have constant time lookup. It’s faster than a linked list because you don’t have to search every name and faster than an array because you don’t need to do binary search

![Screenshot (89).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(89).png)

![Screenshot (91).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(91).png)

You can include 2nd or 3rd letters to increase the number of names with a constant search algorithm 👇🏾:

![Screenshot (92).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(92).png)

**Disadvantage:** it carries a huge amount of memory. The number of cells here alone is 26 x 26 x 26.

This is how we can represent these nodes in the tree👇🏾:

![Screenshot (96).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(96).png)

If we are using a one dimensional hash table, you can see that the items (in this case names) hash out to a particular number👇🏾;

![Albus hashes out to 0 as it begins with ‘A’.](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(97).png)

Albus hashes out to 0 as it begins with ‘A’.

![Zacharias hashes out to 25 as it begins with ‘Z’.](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(98).png)

Zacharias hashes out to 25 as it begins with ‘Z’.

# Tri

A **tri** is a tree each of whose node is an array.

![Screenshot (99).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(99).png)

![Screenshot (100).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(100).png)

At the end of the name, you will need some algorithm to indicate that it’s the end.

This can be repeated for other related names as well👇🏾:

![This is a search for the names “Hagrid” and “Harry”.](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(101).png)

This is a search for the names “Hagrid” and “Harry”.

![This is a search for the words “hey”, “help” and “hello”.](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(103).png)

This is a search for the words “hey”, “help” and “hello”.

Its data structure can be written as👇🏾:

![Screenshot (102).png](Data%20Structures%2009ceec29c11e43b7ac9f09019a946abb/Screenshot_(102).png)

## Disadvantage

- It also takes a lot of space.
