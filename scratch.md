# Scratch
Before touching Scratch, we will briefly elucidate on other topics to be covered later in this course.

## Pseudocode
**Pseudocode** refers to the translation of something verbal into a code format. It is just a format in which programmers define in stages how they will write their program in a more human-readable format
e.g. Pseudocode to search a name on a phonebook:point_down::
```text
- Pickup phone book
- Open to middle of page
- Look at page
- If person is on page
    - Call person
- Else if person is earlier in book
    - Open to middle of the left half of the book
    - Go back to line 3
- Else if person is later in the book
    - Open to middle of the right half of the book
    - Go back to line 3
- Else
- Quit.
```
