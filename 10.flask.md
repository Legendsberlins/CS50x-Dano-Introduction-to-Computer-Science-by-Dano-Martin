# Flask

# Path and Route

A **path** is a location on your computer or server of some piece of information. It’s similar to a route. A **route** defines how an application responds to a specific URL or path.

Everything after the single slash is a path. It’s where you can find the file in the server.

# Flask

**Flask** is a python framework, a third party library that is used to develop web applications.

To run your webserver using this framework, use command `flask run`. By convention, you use [`app.py`](http://app.py) to create a python file using flask library.

The code below implements a web application that spits out any content in your `index.html` file👇🏾:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) #convention in flask to create a web application in python is that you create a variable called app and assign it the return value of Flask function.

@app.route("/") #decides based on the browsers request what files to send from the server to the browser. Basically what http-server did based on the filename.
def index():
		return render_template ("index.html") #returns the contents of your index.html file from your templates folder.
```

The convention to convert a web app in python to flask is that you create a variable called `app` and assign it the return value of `Flask` function `(__name__)`. `return render_template("index.html”)` returns the contents of your HTML file in your templates folder, mixing it with your python code. The templates folder stores all your HTML files in one place and serve it however we want.

You can also access the HTTP parameters a user provides in the URL using a special flask `dict` variable called `request` . Note that `request.args` is only used with GET method, for POST method `request.form` is used👇🏾:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) 
@app.route("/") 
def index():
    if "name" in request.args: 
        name = request.args["name"]
    else:
        name = "world"
	return render_template ("index.html", placeholder = name)
```

Our `index.html` file will look like this👇🏾:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>Web app</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello {{placeholder}}</h1> <!--Placeholder can be called anything-->
    </body>
</html>
```

Therefore, if we have a `/?name= value` in the URL, it outputs our name👇🏾:

![Screenshot (161).png](Screenshot_(161).png)

In order to shorten the code, you can replace the conditions in our python file with a `get` function👇🏾:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) 
@app.route("/") 
def index():
    name = request.args.get("name","world") 
    return render_template("index.html", placeholder = name)
```

## Forms

You can solve real life problems using flask. In the codes below, we create an HTML form file and greeting file where the user types a name in the form and the name is printed👇🏾:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>Web app</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
    <body>
        <form action = "/greet" method = "get"> <!--/greet has to match the route in app.py-->
            <input type = "text" placeholder ="name" name ="name" autofocus autocomplete ="off">
            <button type = "submit">Greet</button>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>Web app</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Hello {{placeholder}}</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) 

@app.route("/") 
def form():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/greet") #/greet can be anything
def greet():
    name = request.args.get("name", "world")
    return render_template("greet.html", placeholder = name) #you can also use return render_template("greet.html", placeholder = request.args.get("name", "world)) and exclude the previous line
```

You can also use return `render_template("greet.html", placeholder = request.args.get("name", "world))` and exclude the previous line to shorten our code👇🏾:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) #convention in flask to create a web application in python is that you create a variable called app and assign it the return value of Flask function.

@app.route("/") #decides based on the browsers request what files to send from the server to the browser. Basically what http-server did based on the filename.
def form():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/greet") #/greet can be anything
def greet():
    return render_template("greet.html", placeholder = request.args.get("name", "world"))
```

![Notice how there’s a change in the URL.](Screenshot_(163).png)

Notice how there’s a change in the URL.

## Jinja Layout

Flask also allows us to create a layout whereby we would avoid redundancy when using multiple files of the same type. This can be done with a **Jinja** syntax. 

**Jinja** is a syntax which allows us to use placeholders in our webpages.

You can place contents of one html file into another html file using syntax👇🏾:

```html
{% block fileplaceholder %}{% endblock %}
```

You then use the syntax below in the file you are moving it’s contents from 👇🏾:

```html
{% extends "newfile.html" %}

{% block fileplaceholder %}
	Contents
{% endblock %}
```

From our previous examples we can plug the contents of `greet.html` and `form.html` into a new HTML file `layout.html`👇🏾:

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}
    <h2>Hello {{placeholder}}</h2>
{% endblock %}
```

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}
    <form action = "/greet" method = "get"> 
        <input type = "text" placeholder ="name" name ="name" autofocus autocomplete ="off">
        <button type = "submit">Greet</button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>Web app</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
    <body>
        {% block body %}{% endblock %}
    </body>
</html>
```

## POST and GET

In the previous examples, our paths contain our data and that may be good for some websites but wouldn’t apply to other websites that contain our personal data. This can be fixed by changing our method to `post` and inserting that into our [`app.py`](http://app.py) file to replace the default, `get`.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) 

@app.route("/") 
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/greet", methods = ["POST"]) 
def greet():
    return render_template("greet.html", placeholder = request.args.get("name", "world"))
```

```html
<form action = "/greet" method = "post">
```

![You can see here that the URL and the webpage don’t show our personal data. The name you put in the form went to the server but it isn’t in your history.](Screenshot_(164).png)

You can see here that the URL and the webpage don’t show our personal data. The name you put in the form went to the server but it isn’t in your history.

You may want to use aggregate different routes to write less lines of code. Here we use `request.form` since it’s a POST method and we change the route in our HTML file.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) 

@app.route("/", methods = ["GET", "POST"]) #any order of methods
def form():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template("index.html")
    elif request.method == "POST":
        return render_template("greet.html", placeholder = request.form.get("name", "world"))
```

```html
<form action = "/" method = "post"> <!--Change route from '/greet' to '/'-->
    <input type = "text" placeholder = "name" name = "name" autofocus autocomplete = "off">
    <button type = "submit">Greet</button>
</form>
```

## Sport form

### First example

You can also create a sport registration form using HTML and python files`form.html`, `success.html` and `app.py`👇🏾:

```html
<form action = "/success" method = "post"> <!--Post so user doesn't register twice-->
    <input type = "text" placeholder ="name" name ="name" autofocus autocomplete ="off">
    <select name = "team">
        <option disabled selected>Teams</option> <!--display a disabled option in the form for transparency-->
        <option value = "brooklyn nets">Brooklyn Nets</option>
        <option value = "LA lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</option>
        <option value = "GSW">Golden State Warriors</option>
    </select>
    <button type = "submit">Register</button>
</form>
```

```html
<h2>You have successfully registered!</h2>
```

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/") 
def form():
    return render_template("form.html")

@app.route("/success", methods = ["POST"])
def success():
    return render_template("success.html")
```

![Screenshot (167).png](Screenshot_(167).png)

![Screenshot (166).png](Screenshot_(166).png)

### Second example

We can improve our form by using a `dict` to store the number of registrants in the form👇🏾:

```html
<form action = "/success" method = "post"> <!--Post so user doesn't register twice-->
    <input type = "text" placeholder ="name" name ="name" autofocus autocomplete ="off">
    <select name = "team">
        <option disabled selected>Teams</option>
        <option value = "brooklyn nets">Brooklyn Nets</option>
        <option value = "LA lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</option>
        <option value = "GSW">Golden State Warriors</option>
    </select>
    <button type = "submit">Register</button>
</form>
```

```html
<ul>
  {% for name in placeholder %}
      <li>{{ name }} is registered for {{ placeholder[name] }}</li> <!--{{name}} represents the name attribute in our form and placeholder represents the placeholder in our app.py file-->
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

```html
<h2>You have successfully registered!</h2>
```

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) #convention in flask to create a web application in python is that you create a variable called app and assign it the return value of Flask function.

REGISTRANTS = {}

@app.route("/") #any order of methods
def form():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/success", methods = ["POST"])
def success():
    name = request.form.get("name") #uses the name we fill in form.html based on name = "name"
    team = request.form.get("team") #uses the team we select in form.html based on name = "team"
    REGISTRANTS[name] = team
    return render_template("success.html")

@app.route("/registrants")
def database():
    return render_template("registrants.html", placeholder = REGISTRANTS)
```

/registrants route can give a result like👇🏾:

![Screenshot (168).png](Screenshot_(168).png)

### Third example

It can be easy to hack the websites in the previous examples as the HTML code serves the clients side and items can easily be edited. You can fix this in your python code.

Here, we created a list of the team options in our form to avoid any malicious attack on our frontend. We then use logic to forward unsuccessful users to `failure.html`. Finally, we use our jinja syntax in `form.html` to iterate through our list placeholder `teams`👇🏾:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__) 

REGISTRANTS = {}

TEAMS = ["Brooklyn Nets", "Los Angeles Lakers", "Golden State Warriors"]

@app.route("/") 
def form():
    return render_template("index.html", teams = TEAMS) #teams is a placeholder for the list SPORTS

@app.route("/success", methods = ["POST"])
def success():
    name = request.form.get("name")
    if not name:
        return render_template("failure.html")

    team = request.form.get("team")
    if team not in TEAMS:
        return render_template("failure.html")

    REGISTRANTS[name] = team
    return render_template("success.html")

@app.route("/registrants")
def database():
    return render_template("registrants.html", placeholder = REGISTRANTS)
```

```html
<form action = "/success" method = "post"> <!--Post so user doesn't register twice-->
	    <input type = "text" placeholder ="name" name ="name" autofocus autocomplete ="off">
	    <select name = "team">
	        <option disabled selected>Teams</option>
	        {% for team in teams %}
	            <option value = "{{team}}">{{team}}</option>
	        {% endfor %}
	    </select>
	    <button type = "submit">Register</button>
</form>
```

```html
<h2>You have NOT registered</h2>
```

![Screenshot (169).png](Screenshot_(169).png)

![User didn’t put in his name and was forwarded to failure.html](Screenshot_(170).png)

User didn’t put in his name and was forwarded to failure.html

You can also use the `required` HTML attribute to make sure a user fills in a particular form. But again, this can easily be breached from the frontend side of things so it just makes the website/application more user friendly👇🏾:

```html
<input type = "text" placeholder ="name" name ="name" required>
```

# CSVs and SQL

A website can crash and this causes loss of data in that website if not stored properly. This is why SQL is usually combined to make sure we have access to database.

# Web cookies

An **HTTP cookie** is a small amount of text that helps a website track information about a user across multiple pages of the website and personalize the users experience. A cookie keeps you logged into a website across multiple pages. Once you are logged into a website, any cookie that has been planted in your computer is represented to the site every time you click a link or make another request to the website.

When a browser sends an HTTP request to a server, the server sends a cookie with an HTTP response. The cookie contains a session id and a unique value for the user. When the user navigates to different pages on the website, the browser sends along the stored cookies in its HTTP request. This happens in sites that require sign in e.g. google.com.

![HTTP response with cookie.](Screenshot_(172).png)

HTTP response with cookie.

You can implement the notion of logging in and out of a website using flask as flask automatically hands out session id’s to users by making sure each user gets a different cookie making sure the session id’s line up with the users.

## Username

The code below implements a login and logout page. **Read the comments for explanation👇🏾:**

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, render_template, request, session
from flask_session import Session

#configure flask
app = Flask(__name__)

#configure cookies session
app.config["SESSION_PERMANENT"] = False
app.config["SESSION_TYPE"] = "filesystem"
Session(app)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    if not session.get("name"): #if not logged in, redirect to login page
        return redirect("/login")
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/login", methods = ["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    if request.method == "POST": #if "POST" method is used, the user should be redirected to index.html and his name from the form should be used.
        session["name"] = request.form.get("name")
        return redirect("/")
    return render_template("login.html") #if "GET" method is used, the user should be redirected to the login page
@app.route("/logout")
def logout():
    session["name"] = None #if the user logs out, remove their session to show that their session has ended
    return redirect("/")
```

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}

    {% if session["name"]%}
        You are logged in as {{ session["name"] }}. <a href = "/logout">Log out</a>
    {% else %}
        You are not logged in. <a href = "/login">Log in</a>
    {% endif %}

{% endblock %}
```

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}

    <form action = "/login" method = "post">
        <input autocomplete = "off" autofocus name = "name" placeholder = "Name" type = "text">
        <input type = "submit" value = "Log In">
    </form>

{% endblock %}
```

This code results in👇🏾:

# API

**APIs** specify how you interact with some service. There’s a lot of web based services you can use to get back data e.g. weather, time etc. HTTP is usually the mechanism used to get data from servers.

# AJAX

**AJAX** is a technique where we can asynchronously (after reloading the page) update our pages. Using JavaScript, listen for an event and when you hear an event you can send a request to the server to get back more data and plug it into the DOM in the computers memory. This makes room for more seamless techniques like autocomplete on our websites. You can also take for example a sports website where small portions (like scores of games/time) update without refreshing the whole page.

# JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

**JSON** is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application or between different parts of an application. It is a raw friendly way for a computer to  return a piece of data that we don’t need to see.
