# The Internet

The first points of the internet was called **ARPANET** IN 1969. **The internet** can be thought as routers that allow data to flow from one point to another. **Routers** are basically interconnected servers. Computers send messages to each other through a network of routers with each message split into packets.

**The ISPs(Internet Service Providers)** make routing decisions in order to route data from one point to another. A particular route may be having a traffic/congestion when a lot of people are using the internet so your data can travel through another route.

**Internet Protocols(IP)** is one of the core protocols of the internet and it is used in all internet communication to handle addressing & routing. When a device sends a message to another, it specifies the **destination IP address** and also the **source IP address** in its **IP packet** so the recipient can reply. ISPs assign IP addresses and give you a different one each time your computer pops on their network. That’s called **dynamic IP address**.

There’s a limit to each message sent from one destination to another as there’s a limit to how much data can be reasonable transmitted at once by the physical network connections between devices. Therefore protocols are split between many small packets which are called **IP packets**.

There are 2 versions of IP:

**IPV4** - split into 4 numbers ranging from 0-255. It has a syntax #.#.#.# e.g 74.125.80.200. These numbers consist of 8 bits each therefore are $2^{32} = 4,294,967,296$ possible addresses for computers on the internet.

**IPV6** - comes with a wider range of numbers as internet users have increased. It consists of hexadecimal numbers which makes it even larger. Its syntax is #:#:#:#:#:#:#:# e.g 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0372:6273. The highest number is FFFF which is 1111 1111 1111 1111 in binary and that alone corresponds to 16 bits ($2^{16}= 65,536)$. Therefore the entire IPV6 has about $2^{128} = 3.40 * 10^{38}$ computers on the internet.

## TCP/IP

**TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)** is a transport protocol which solves problems of distinguishing types of data, ensures reliability, order of IP packets, lost IP packets, duplicates and corrupted packets.

Different things can be done on the internet besides sending texts. Unique numbers are assigned to different services that can be used on the internet using TCP. These are called **port numbers**. Example:

80 - HTTP

443 - HTTPS

Therefore, source port number which is the source IP address: port number  and destination port number (destination IP address: port number) are sent in **IP packets.**

## Web and DNS

The **web** is a massive network of webpages, programs, files accessible via URLs. It’s called a web due to its interconnectedness(can move from one URL to another).

Web browsers(chrome, edge) load webpages using different protocols;

**DNS(Domain Name System) protocol**: makes use of a collection of servers which connect domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. Domain name is made up of three parts:

- **Top-Level-Domain**: a way to understand what the website is about or where it is based. It is produced by root servers which are larger servers. Examples of TLD are: .edu, .jobs, .int, .org, .net and country codes like: .ng, .us, .ca, .es.
- **Second-Level-Domain(Domain name)**: smaller servers owned by companies which is unique to the name of the organization that registers it. Examples: khanacademy, google.
- **Third-Level-Domain(subdomain)**: isn’t mandatory but adds clarity. Examples: [ftp.mydomain.com](http://ftp.mydomain.com) where ‘ftp’ is the third-level-domain or [support.mydomain.com](http://support.mydomain.com) where ‘support’ is the third-level-domain.

These DNS servers just contain keys(Domain names) and values(IP addresses).

HTTPS - HTTP secure

WWW - host name

example - Domain name

.com - Top Level Domain

/folder/file.html - path of the webpage

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

Whenever you visit a page on the web, your computer uses HTTP to download that page from another computer on the internet. HTTP is a protocol built on top of TCP/IP. 

Once the browser finally identifies the IP address of the computer hosting the requested URL, it sends an **HTTP request** which uses verbs like GET, POST to make the request. The host then receives the HTTP request and sends back an **HTTP response** with both the content of the page and metadata about it. Each HTTP request is inside an IP packet and each HTTP response is inside another IP packet/multiple packets.

![HTTP request and response.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(156).png)

HTTP request and response.

**HTTPS** is a secure HTTP version

An HTTP request may look like👇🏾:

![The first line just specifies the version of HTTP and the second line specifies the path of the page being requested.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(134).png)

The first line just specifies the version of HTTP and the second line specifies the path of the page being requested.

An HTTP response may look like👇🏾:

![This also includes the HTML version. ‘200 OK’ represents the HTTP status code which indicates a successful retrieval of the document. The content type represents what the page consists of and the remaining request will be the webpage content. If the page doesn’t load successfully the status code provides more information.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(136).png)

This also includes the HTML version. ‘200 OK’ represents the HTTP status code which indicates a successful retrieval of the document. The content type represents what the page consists of and the remaining request will be the webpage content. If the page doesn’t load successfully the status code provides more information.

![Here, the content of the URL loaded isn’t found therefore the status code of the HTTP response changes.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(137).png)

Here, the content of the URL loaded isn’t found therefore the status code of the HTTP response changes.

![Request and response with HTTP status code 404 (Not found).](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(158).png)

Request and response with HTTP status code 404 (Not found).

![The different status codes.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(138).png)

The different status codes.

Service Unavailable - server is overloaded

Internal Server Error - Similar to segmentation fault

Forbidden - the user probably forgot to login 

You can pass human input to a server. Google supports this👇🏾:

![‘q’ here means query and you can put anything you want to search after that. This example searches for a cat.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(139).png)

‘q’ here means query and you can put anything you want to search after that. This example searches for a cat.

# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

**HTML** is not a programming language but a markup language used to give structure to webpages. HTML makes use of tags(elements) and attributes.

**HTML elements/tags** tell the browser how to display the content. It’s syntax is👇🏾:

```html
<>content</>
```

Some HTML elements don’t have closing tags and some are **empty elements**(elements with no content) e.g `<hr>`,`<br>`.

**HTML attributes** provide additional information about HTML elements. They are found in HTML tags.

You can use `http-server` on your terminal to run your HTML code.

You can write a simple HTML code as shown👇🏾:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>My title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>`is just an HTML standard declaration. All the HTML code should be inside the `<html>` tag then we have the `<head>` which may consist of metadata about our page, the title, external resource links. `<body>` consists of the contents of the web page. `lang` in the html tag is an attribute.

Web browsers build a structure in a computers memory to interpret HTML code. This structure is called  **DOM(Document Object Model)**👇🏾:

![Screenshot (140).png](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(140).png)

## Elements

A few other HTML elements include👇🏾:

- `<h></h>` - Indicates a heading. It ranges from `<h1>`-`<h6>` where `<h1>` is the largest heading and `<h6>` is the smallest.
- `<p></p>` - Indicates a paragraph.
- `<a></a>` - the anchor tag links a web page to another. It consists of an `href` attribute which specifies the URL of an interconnected page. It may also contain other attributes like target(specifies where the `href` should be opened), download(gives an option to download the `href`). Below is a code to show this
    - 👇🏾:
        
        ```html
        <p>Click image to download</p>
        <a href = "sportslogo.png" download>
           <img src = "sportslogo.png" alt = "M sports logo" width = "200" height = "200">
        </a>
        ```
        
- `<li></li>` - Stands for a list. There are 3 types of lists in HTML: ordered list`<ol></ol>`, unordered list `<ul></ul>` and description list `<dl></dl>` which consists of description term`<dt></dt>` and description details `<dd></dd>`. Below is a code example and its result
    - 👇🏾:
        
        ```html
        <ul>
                    <li>Foo</li>
                    <li>Bar</li>
                    <li>Baz</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Foo</li>
                    <li>Bar</li>
                    <li>Baz</li>
                </ol>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Foo</dt>
                    <dd>...........</dd>
                    <dt>Bar</dt>
                    <dd>............</dd>
                    <dt>Baz</dt>
                    <dd>............</dd>
                </dl>
        ```
        
        ![Screenshot (141).png](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(141).png)
        
- `<table></table>` - A table consists of a row and columns. HTML table consists of 3 elements:
    
    `<tr></tr>` - Table row
    
    `<th></th>` - Table header. It’s bold by default and serves as the columns for the header.
    
    `<td></td>` - table data. Replaces `<th>` when listing the contents of the columns.
    
    Below is a code example and its result
    
    - 👇🏾:
        
        ```html
        <table>
        	   <tr>
        	      <th>First No.</th>
                <th>Second No.</th>
                <th>Third No.</th>
        	   </tr>
        	   <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>3</td>
        	   </tr>
        	   <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>6</td>
             </tr>
        </table>
        ```
        
        ![Screenshot (143).png](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(143).png)
        
- `<img>` - used to insert images in a page. It consists of different attributes like:
    
    `src` - is the link/path to the image.
    
    `alt` - serves as an alternative for a user in case the image can’t load.
    
    `title` - is the name shown when a user hovers around an image.
    
    `width` - how wide an image is e.g 300 x 200 means 300 is the width.
    
    `height` - how long an image is e.g. 300 x 200 means 200 is the height.
    
    `loading` - shows how long it takes an image to load. It has 2 values (`eager` and `lazy`). `Eager` loads an image immediately while `lazy` lets the page load before the images and is mostly used with images below the fold. 
    
    Below is a code example and its result
    
    - 👇🏾:
        
        ```html
        <body>
        	  <img src = "sportslogo.png" alt = "M sports logo" title = "Official M sports logo" height = "200" width = "200" loading = "eager">
        </body>
        ```
        
        ![Screenshot (144).png](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(144).png)
        
- `<picture></picture>` - brings flexibility in specifying image resources. Rather than use one image, you can make use of multiple images based on viewport width. It consists of one or more `<source>` tags and an `<img>` tag. The image in the `<img>` tag is used when the images in the `<source>` tag don’t fall under the category. Below is a code example and its result
    - 👇🏾:
        
        ```html
        <picture>
                    <source srcset = "sportslogo.png" media = "(min-width:1000px)">
                    <source srcset = "Logo-NBA.png" media = "(min-width: 600px)">
                    <img src = "PL.jpeg" alt = "Premier League logo" width = "100%" height = "100%">
        </picture>
        ```
        
        ![In devices of width 1000px or more, this image is displayed.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(147).png)
        
        In devices of width 1000px or more, this image is displayed.
        
        ![In devices of width 600px and more, this image is displayed.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(148).png)
        
        In devices of width 600px and more, this image is displayed.
        
- `<video></video>` - used to insert videos. It usually consists of at least one `<source>` tag with different video sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports. Any text within a `<video>` tag will only be displayed in browsers that don’t support the video element.
    
    Below is a code example and its result 
    
    - 👇🏾:
        
        ```html
        <video width = "1280" height = "600" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src = "car anime.mp4" type = "video/mp4">
            <source src = "movie.ogg" type = "video/ogg">
        		Your browser doesn't support this video type
        </video>
        ```
        
        ![Screenshot (146).png](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(146).png)
        
- `<form></form>` - allows users to send input. It can contain attributes like: `action` (specifies where to send form data once it’s submitted), `autocomplete`(specifies whether the browser should autocomplete values based on what the user inputted previously), `method`(specifies the HTTP method used to send data), `target`(specifies where to display the response once submitted) and more. It can also contain elements like👇🏾:
    
    `<input>` - used to input several types of data. It can contain several attributes e.g. `type` which can have values like text, button, checkbox, color, date, range, password.
    
    `<label></label>` - Used to label inputs.
    
    `<select></select>` - defines a dropdown list.
    
    `<option></option>` - defines an output that can be selected. By default, the first item in the dropdown list is selected but you can use a `select` attribute to change that.
    
    `<textarea></textarea>` - allows the user to have an input field and can consist of attributes like `name`, `rows`, `cols`.
    
    `<fieldset></fieldset>` - used to group related data in a form.
    
    `<legend></legend>` - consists of a name given to each field set.
    
    Below is a code example and its result
    
    - 👇🏾:
        
        ![Screenshot (150).png](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(150).png)
        
        ```html
        <form action = "https://www.google.com/search" autocomplete target = "_blank">
             <fieldset>
                 <legend>Personal</legend>
                 <label>Name:</label>
                 <input autofocus name = "q" type = "search"> <!--You can replace search with some other types-->
                 <input type = "submit" value = "Search Google">
             </fieldset>
        </form>
        ```
        
        ![Screenshot (151).png](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(151).png)
        
        ![Here the user submitted the word “dogs” in his form and it forwards him to the search link he used in his action attribute which is google.](HTML,%20CSS,%20JavaScript%20f0b68e01f6744b2a92d56964880357fd/Screenshot_(152).png)
        
        Here the user submitted the word “dogs” in his form and it forwards him to the search link he used in his action attribute which is google.
        

## Meta tag

`<Meta>` tag defines meta data about an HTML document. It is usually written in the `<head>` tag. It would be used by browsers, search engines. When a user sends a URL of a website, it usually displays an image, text and other items. These contents can be found in the `<meta>` tag of an HTML page. Its syntax is👇🏾:

```html
<meta name = "" content = "">
```

`<meta>` tags also help in responsiveness of each device👇🏾:

```html
<meta name = "viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

`<meta>` tags also set the duration a page stays before refreshing👇🏾:

```html
<meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "30">
```

`<meta>` tags also specify the character encoding for an HTML document👇🏾:

```html
<meta charset = "UTF-8">
```

## HTML entities and Diacritical marks

**HTML entities** are used to replace texts/characters that can’t be directly typed out in HTML and they usually begin with an ampersand(&). Examples of HTML entities:

| Entities | Use |
| --- | --- |
| &nbsp | To keep 2/more words together or space a line without break |
| &lt | Indents a < symbol |
| &gt | Indents a > symbol |
| &amp | Indents a & symbol |
| &copy | Indents a copyright symbol |
| &quot | Indents a double quote |
| &apos | Indents a single quote/apostrophe |
| &cent | Indents a cent symbol |
| &pound | Indents a pound symbol |
| &reg | Indents a registered symbol |

**A diacritical mark** is a "glyph" added to a letter.

| Mark | Character | Construct | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ̀ | a | a&#768; | à |
| ́ | a | a&#769; | á |
| ̂ | a | a&#770; | â |
| ̃ | a | a&#771; | ã |
| ̀ | O | O&#768; | Ò |
| ́ | O | O&#769; | Ó |
| ̂ | O | O&#770; | Ô |
| ̃ | O | O&#771; | Õ |

## Semantic Elements

Semantic elements help organize HTML code. They make meaning to the developer. Examples: `<article>`, `<aside>`,`<details>`,`<figcaption>`,`<figure>`,`<footer>`, `<header>`,`<main>`,`<mark>`,`<nav>`,`<section>`,`<summary>`,`<time>` ,`<thead>`,`<tbody>`,`<tfoot>`.

**N/B**: All these elements have opening and closing tags

## Div and Span elements

A `<div>` is a generic block level element(elements that begin on a different line) that specifies a division in an HTML code. It can replace some semantic elements and vice versa. It usually contains `class` or `id` attribute for easy styling.

A `<span>` is an inline element(elements that continue on the same line) that marks up a part of a text/document. It is usually used when some parts of an element should be styled differently

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS brings aesthetics into web pages. It consists of properties.

CSS declaration has syntax👇🏾:

```css
selector
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

There are 3 ways of inserting CSS into your HTML file:

**External CSS** - Involves using the `<link>` tag in the head of your HTML to reference your CSS file.

**Internal CSS** -  Involves using the `<style>` tag in the head of your HTML to write CSS.

**Inline CSS** - Involves using a `style` attribute in the body of your HTML to style any element you want.

```css
<head>
		<link href = "filename.css" type ="text/css" rel = "stylesheet">
</head>
```

```css
<head>
		<style>
				selector
				{
						property: property-value;
				}
		</style>
</head>
```

```css
<body>
		<element style = "property: property-value;">content</element> 
</body>
```

## Selectors

Selectors are what you select when you want to style your HTML code. There are 5 CSS selectors👇🏾:

**Element selector**: is based on element name.

**Class selector**: is based on HTML `class` name. It usually starts with a full stop(.). If two elements have the same `class` but you want to style one of them, you can be specific by mixing the element with the class. 

**ID selector**: Uses `id` attribute to select what to style. It usually begins with a hash(#). 

**Universal selector**: Selects all the HTML on a page. Begins with an asterisk(*).

**Grouping selector**: Groups multiple selectors using a comma(,). Ignoring a comma implies you are selecting an element inside another element. 

```css
element
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

```css
*
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

```css
.class
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

```css
selector, selector
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

```css
#id
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

```css
element.class
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

These selectors have specificity. Specificity is the ranking of selectors from highest to lowest priority. If two selectors point to the same element, specificity is used to detect how it’s styled.

Style → ID → Class, Pseudo-class →Element 

Elements styled with internal CSS have the highest specificity and elements styled by element selector have the lowest.

E.g👇🏾:

```css
element #id
{
		property: property-value;
}
```

## CSS frameworks

**Frameworks** are used to simplify code for a developer. It’s basically using another developers code. There are CSS frameworks like bootstrap, tailwind where a developer just needs to copy the link of another developers work after reading the documentation of the work and add to his HTML head using `<link>`.

# JavaScript

**JavaScript** is one of the most popular programming languages today that is used in web and mobile applications.

## Conditionals

**Conditionals** in JavaScript are similar to conditionals in c👇🏾:

```jsx
if (x > y)
{

}
else if (x < y)
{

}
else
{

}
```

## Variables

### Declaring variables

In JS, **variables** are declared using keywords `var`/`let`/`const`👇🏾:

One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the `var` keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations👇🏾:

```jsx
var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);

```

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A keyword called `let` was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the `var` keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

If you replace `var` with `let` in the code above, it results in an error👇🏾:

```jsx
let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";
```

The error can be seen in your browser console.

So unlike `var`, when you use `let`, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

### Incrementing variables

You can increment variables in 3 ways👇🏾:

```jsx
variable = variable + 1;
```

```jsx
variable += 1;
```

```jsx
variable++;
```

## Loops

You can implement **loops** in JS just like C except that you use the keywords let/const to declare the variable👇🏾:

```jsx
for (let i = 0, i < 3; i++)
{

}
```

You can also loop infinitely in JS👇🏾:

```jsx
while(true)
{

}
```

## Events

An **Event** is something graphical that just happens in a computer program. We trigger events on our devices when we click, drag etc. In JS you can write code that adheres to these events.

The code below gives a message alert to the user once the form is submitted with the help of the JavaScript function `greet`. `return false` here just makes sure the form isn’t submitted to the server side but the clients side.

```html
<head>
    <title>My page</title>
    <script>
        function greet()
        {
            alert('Hello, World');
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <form onsubmit = "greet(); return false;" target = "_blank">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Personal</legend>
            <label>Name:</label>
            <input autofocus type = "text"> 
            <button type = "submit">Search</button>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
</body>
```

You can also replace ‘World’ with what the user queries using `.querySelector` function which is a function built into the object👇🏾:

```html
<head>
    <title>My page</title>
    <script>
        function greet()
        {
            let name = document.querySelector('#name').value;
            alert('Hello, ' + name);
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <form onsubmit = "greet(); return false;" target = "_blank">
	        <fieldset>
            <legend>Personal</legend>
            <label>Name:</label>
            <input autofocus type = "text" id = "name">
            <button type = "submit">Google Search</button>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
</body>
```

You can separate our JS code from our HTML and still achieve the same thing👇🏾:

```html
<body>
    <form target = "_blank">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Personal</legend>
            <label>Name:</label>
            <input autofocus type = "text" id = "name">
            <button type = "submit">Google Search</button>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
    <script>
            document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', function(event){
            let name = document.querySelector('#name').value;
            alert('Hello, ' + name);
            event.preventDefault(); //replaces return false;
        })
    </script>
</body>
```

JS code is interpreted from top to bottom so we had to place the JS code which calls the HTML `form` tag below it but you can fix that using the `addEventListener` function👇🏾:

```html
<head>
    <title>My page</title>
    <script>
            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
                document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', function(event){
                    let name = document.querySelector('#name').value;
                    alert('Hello, ' + name);
                    event.preventDefault(); //replaces return false;
                });
            });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <form target = "_blank">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Personal</legend>
            <label>Name:</label>
            <input autofocus type = "text" id = "name">
            <button type = "submit">Google Search</button>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
</body>
```

## Keystrokes

You can use HTML and JS to make a DOM update by itself when a user types👇🏾:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>My page</title>
        <script src="keystroke.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form target = "_blank">
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Personal</legend>
                <label>Name:</label>
                <input autofocus type = "text" id = "name">
            </fieldset>
            <p></p>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

```jsx
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){
    let input = document.querySelector('input');
    input.addEventListener('keyup', function(event){
        let name = document.querySelector('p');
        if (input.value){
            name.innerHTML = `Hello, ${input.value}`;
        }
        else{
            name.innerHTML = 'Hello';
        }
    });
});
```

## Manipulating CSS

JS can be used to manipulate CSS. When trying to manipulate a CSS property in JS, you should use a camel case without any special character e.g. `background-color` is `backgroundColor` in JS. Our code below changes each button color when clicked to it’s corresponding color👇🏾:

```jsx
<body>
    <button id = "red">R</button>
    <button id = "blue">B</button>
    <button id = "green">G</button>
    <script>
        
        let body = document.querySelector('body');
        document.querySelector('#red').addEventListener('click', function(){
            body.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
        });
        let body = document.querySelector('body');
        document.querySelector('#blue').addEventListener('click', function(){
            body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
        });
        let body = document.querySelector('body');
        document.querySelector('#green').addEventListener('click', function(){
            body.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
        });
    </script>
</body>
```

## Blinking

The `window` variable is similar to the `document` variable but it refers to everything in the window itself. The `window` comes with a `setInterval` function which allows you to set an interval (in ms) and after every expiration of the interval, a function will be called. Example👇🏾:

```jsx
window.setInterval(blink, 500); //blink will be a defined function
```

The code below blinks the HTML code every 500ms👇🏾:

```html
<head>
        <title>My page</title>
        <script>
            function blink()
            {
                let body = document.querySelector('body');
                if (body.style.visibility == 'hidden')
                {
                    body.style.visibility = 'visible';
                }
                else
                {
                    body.style.visibility = 'hidden';
                }
                window.setInterval(blink, 500);
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello world!</p>
    </body>
```
