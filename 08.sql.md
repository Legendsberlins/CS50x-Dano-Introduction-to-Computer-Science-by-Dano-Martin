# SQL(Structured Query Language)

# Intro

**SQL** is a language for querying databases i.e. storing data in it, updating it, inserting it, deleting it.

# CSV files python

In the example below (using python), we printed a particular row of a csv file by looping through the entire csv file. This code prints all the columns in the 2nd row(first index) of the csv fileüëáüèæ:

```python
import csv

file = open("countries.csv", "r")
file_reader = csv.reader(file)

for row in file_reader:
    print(row[1])
```

Hypothetically speaking, this outputsüëáüèæ:

```bash
Continents
Africa
Europe
Africa
Asia
Oceania
North america
South america
Europe
Europe
Africa
```

You can use the `next(variablename)` function to skip the header of the rows. This will exclude the ‚Äúcontinents‚Äù outputted in the previous exampleüëáüèæ:

```python
import csv

file = open("countries.csv", "r")
file_reader = csv.reader(file)
next(file_reader)

for row in file_reader:
    print(row[1])
```

```bash
Africa
Europe
Africa
Asia
Oceania
North america
South america
Europe
Europe
Africa
```

You can also use the `csv.DictReader()` function to arrange it in a `dict` format and access the contents of your csv file more efficiently.

```python
import csv

file = open("countries.csv", "r")
file_reader = csv.DictReader(file)

for row in file_reader:
    print(row["Continents"])
```

In the example below, the code counts the total number of countries in the `countries.csv` file in each of the following continents. Notice how at the end of the loop we used `elif` not `else`? You can also use `else` but `elif` is more appropriate based on style, it indicates that more conditions can be addedüëáüèæ:

```python
import csv

file = open("countries.csv", "r")
file_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
africa, europe, oceania, south_america, north_america, asia = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

for row in file_reader:
    continent = row["Continents"]
    if continent == "Africa":
        africa += 1
    elif continent == "Europe":
        europe += 1
    elif continent == "Oceania":
        oceania += 1
    elif continent == "South america":
        south_america += 1
    elif continent == "North america":
        north_america += 1
    elif continent == "Asia":
        asia += 1

print("Africa:",africa ,"Europe:",europe ,"Oceania:",oceania ,"South america:",south_america ,"North america:",north_america ,"Asia:",asia)
```

We simplified this code by using a dict in this example called `country_count` which stores the values of the `file_reader`. We then used the row variable to loop round the `file_reader` and used a conditional (basically asking if continent is in our dict) to increment or initialize our `country_count[continent]` variable. This prints out the same thing as the example aboveüëáüèæ:

```python
import csv

file = open("countries.csv", "r")
file_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
country_count = {}

for row in file_reader:
    continent = row["Continents"]
    if continent in country_count:
        country_count[continent] += 1
    else:
        country_count[continent] = 1

for continent in country_count:
    print(continent,":", country_count[continent])
```

The code below defines a function (`sort_by_value`), then implements `key = sort_by_value`(our function) to sort our output by its value. In this case it is sorted from highest to lowest due to the `reverse = True` syntax.

```python
import csv

file = open("countries.csv", "r")
file_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
country_count = {}

for row in file_reader:
    continent = row["Continents"]
    if continent in country_count:
        country_count[continent] += 1
    else:
        country_count[continent] = 1

def sort_by_value(continents):
    return country_count[continents]

for continent in sorted(country_count, key = sort_by_value, reverse = True):
    print(continent,":", country_count[continent])
```

In python you can make use of an `anonymous`/`lambda` function (a function that you are only using in one place or has only one expression). Its syntax isüëáüèæ:

```python
key = lambda argument: return
```

Therefore, the code below gets rid of the function we defined (`get_value`) and makes use of a lambda function in one line of codeüëáüèæ:

```python
import csv

file = open("countries.csv", "r")
file_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
country_count = {}

for row in file_reader:
    continent = row["Continents"]
    if continent in country_count:
        country_count[continent] += 1
    else:
        country_count[continent] = 1

for continent in sorted(country_count, key = lambda continents: country_count[continents], reverse = True):
    print(continent,":", country_count[continent])
```

# Relational database and SQL

**Relational database** is a popular way of storing a lot of data. The types of relational database are mySQL, postgres, oracle, SQLite etc. 

## SQL Commands

It‚Äôs a language used for web apps, mobile apps. It does 4 basic things using the mnemonic CRUD:

**Mnemonic**

C - Creating data

R - Reading data

U - Updating data

D - Deleting data

**Matching Command**

CREATE, INSERT

SELECT

UPDATE

DELETE, DROP

To create an SQLite file, use the syntaxüëáüèæ:

```sql
$ sqlite3 filename.db
```

You can create a table using SQLite syntaxüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> CREATE TABLE tablename (column datatype, ...);
```

You can also do this by importing a csv file into your SQL using SQLite syntax üëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .import csvfilename.csv columnname.csv
```

The code above doesn‚Äôt change the appearance of your screen. To see the changes and scheme of your table, use SQLite commandüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> .schema
```

To select data from a SQL database, use the syntaxüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT column(s) FROM tablename;
```

If you want to select all the columns you can use an asterisk(`*`)üëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * FROM tablename;
```

To insert data into a database use syntaxüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> INSERT INTO table (column, ...) VALUES(value,...);
```

To update(replace) a particular data, use syntaxüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> UPDATE table SET column = value WHERE condition;
```

Exampleüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> UPDATE countries SET continents = 'Australia' WHERE continents = 'Oceania';
```

To delete all rows containing a particular word, you can use the `DELETE` functionüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> DELETE FROM tablename WHERE column = '';
```

***We usually capitalize SQL keywords just for stylistic purposes.**

## SQL functions

SQL has some functions like: `AVG`, `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `LOWER`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `UPPER`.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename;
```

You can use the function `DISTINCT` to get back all the different values in a particular column maybe in order to narrow down your work üëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT(column) FROM tablename;
```

You can combine different functionsüëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(column)) FROM tablename;
```

You can change the heading to whatever you want using keyword `AS` üëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(column)) AS Newheader FROM tablename;
```

## More keywords

SQL has more keywords like `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN` etc. The examples below come from our previous countries.csv file

**WHERE** - allows us to filter data (use WHERE when a conditional occurs)üëáüèæ.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries WHERE continents = 'Africa';
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries WHERE continent = 'Africa' AND countries = 'Nigeria';
```

**LIKE** - is an alternative to an equal signüëáüèæ.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE 'Steve C%';
```

**ORDER BY** - handles sortingüëáüèæ.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT continents, COUNT(*) FROM countries GROUP BY continents ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT continents, COUNT(*) FROM countries GROUP BY continents ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**LIMIT** - includes a restriction to our code.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT continents, COUNT(*) FROM countries GROUP BY continents ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**GROUP BY** - gets data by a certain attribute.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT continents, COUNT(*) FROM countries GROUP BY continents;
```

This outputs a table of two columns - `Continents` and `COUNT(*)`.

**JOIN** - Joins tables together

```sql
sqlite> SELECT column FROM tablename1 JOIN tablename2 ON tablename1.PRIMARYKEY = tablename2.PRIMARYKEY
```

# IMDb

**Internet Movie Database (IMDb)** makes some of their movie data available for download as `csv` files, `tsv` files. You find multiple linked tables in their site.

The diagram is used to show the relationship between the six tablesüëáüèæ:

## SQLite datatypes and constraints

SQLite has 5 datatypes:

**BLOB(Binary Large Object)** - is a binary datatype that doesn‚Äôt necessarily fit into the other categories.

**INTEGER** - whole numbers

**NUMERIC** - numbers that are formatted specially e.g. a date(YYYY/MM/DD)

**REAL** - similar to float. Needs a decimal point and a number after.

**TEXT** - basically strings.

SQLite also has constraints:

**NOT NULL** - makes sure cells in a particular column aren‚Äôt null (empty).

**UNIQUE** - ensures that all values in a particular column are distinct.

**Primary key and Foreign key**

**PRIMARY KEY** - uniquely identifies each record in a table. E.g `PRIMARY KEY(id)` means that the `id` field is the unique field in a table.

**FOREIGN KEY** - a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables to control the data that can be stored in the foreign key table. 

![Screenshot (117).png](Screenshot_(117).png)

![Screenshot (116).png](Screenshot_(116).png)

`show_id`  and `person_id` are FOREIGN KEYS as they correspond to the `id`(PRIMARY KEY) in the first image so they are linked. 

You can still use two methods to find out the name of the show with the `show_id` 62614üëáüèæ:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * FROM shows where id = 62614;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * FROM shows WHERE id IN(SELECT * FROM stars);
```

`IN` is used when we are looking for many things/a list of things. We can use `=` if we are only looking for one thing e.g. an id

The image below displays code using both explicit and Implicit join which output the same thingüëáüèæ:

**Explicit join**

![Screenshot (120).png](Screenshot_(120).png)

![Screenshot (121).png](Screenshot_(121).png)

**Implicit join**

![Screenshot (119).png](Screenshot_(119).png)

If you don‚Äôt know the exact name you are searching for, you can use the `%` which is a wildcard and the `LIKE` keywordüëáüèæ:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE 'Steve C%';
```

# Index

You can also tell the database to index data for you. This can speed up the time it takes to find a particular record in a database.

```sql
CREATE INDEX name ON tablename (column, ...);
```

Creating an index creates a B-tree in a computers memory which makes it easier to search through data.

![Screenshot (122).png](Screenshot_(122).png)

After creating the index once, you can continue programming in SQL which will be outputted in a much shorter time.

A downside is it takes a lot of space in memory.

# Python with SQL

You can work with python and SQL hand in hand. To implement SQL in a python file, the syntax below creates a variable asking the `SQL` library from `cs50` to open the SQL file that we have using `sqlite`:

```python
from cs50 import SQL

variablename = SQL("sqlite:///sqlfilename.db")
```

Python supports strings so if you include quotes in a SQL code, it can be prompted in python.

Using our previous example, the code below prompts a user to input their continent and a `row` variable is created which uses the `.execute` function to execute SQL in python. We then loop through the `rows` and print all the all the field `continents` records of `Africa`üëáüèæ:

```python
from cs50 import SQL

db = SQL("sqlite:///sql.db")
continent = input("Continent: ")

rows = db.execute("SELECT * FROM countries WHERE continents = 'Africa'")

for row in rows:
    print(row["Continents"])
```

If you want to print out what the user types as their continent instead of just `Africa` like the previous example, you can use a `?` which represents a placeholder in pythonüëáüèæ:

```python
from cs50 import SQL

db = SQL("sqlite:///sql.db")
continent = input("Continent: ")

rows = db.execute("SELECT * FROM countries WHERE continents = ?", continent)

for row in rows:
    print(row["Continents"])
```

**N/B**: It‚Äôs not safe to use the format method ahead of the placeholder `?` method in SQL as it can lead to hacking.

# Race condition

**Race condition** is a condition whereby there are a lot of actions taken at the same time in a software which interfere with each other. 

For example, many people like a post on social media at the same time leading to some of those likes interfering with each other.

![This code for example can be used to update likes on social media.](Screenshot_(124).png)

This code for example can be used to update likes on social media.

There are some SQL keywords which help solve this problem like: `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.

`BEGIN TRANSACTION` - marks the beginning of a sequence of statements.

`COMMIT` - commits to making a decision.

`ROLLBACK` - goes back to the previous action if an interference is sensed.
