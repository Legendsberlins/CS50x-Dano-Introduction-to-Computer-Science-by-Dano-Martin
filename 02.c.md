# C

# Intro

**C** is a general-purpose programming language and one of the oldest programming languages. It uses high speed compared to programming languages like Python and Java.

# Source code

A **source code** is a code written by a programmer.

# Machine code

A **machine code** is a code converted in patterns of 0’s and 1’s that the computer understands. Your source code will be compiled to a machine code via a command.

# Compiler

A **complier** is a program whose job is to make the conversion from source to machine code.

# Terminal window

A **terminal window** provides a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) which is the opposite of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI). It is a means of interacting with a computer program by inputting lines of text called **command-lines**. `$` indicates a terminal window in a Unix-like OS.

# Commands

## **To create a program tab**

```bash
$ code hello.c
```

## To compile/recompile a tab to machine code

```bash
$ make hello
```

## To run a program

```bash
$ ./hello
```

## To clear the terminal

```bash
$ clear
```

## Linux commands

**Linux** is best known for specifically its Command Line Interface (CLI) but not that MacOS and windows don’t also have commands. 

An **integrated development environment** (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.

**CS50 IDE** is a cloud based machine running ubuntu - one of the many flavors of the Linux OS.

Here are a list of commands 👇🏾:

- `ls`: It lists the files in your folder. The asterisk seen once the files are listed means the machine code is executable.
- `mv`: It is used to move & rename files. e.g. 👇🏾:

```bash
$ mv hello hello.c
```

- `cd`: It is used to change a directory e.g. 👇🏾:

```bash
$ cd pset1/
```

You can include `..` to navigate to the directory before a particular directory e.g. `cd ..` and you can also include `.` to navigate to the current directory e.g. `cd .` .You can also move to a particular folder in the directory e.g. `cd pset0`

`pwd`**(present working directory)**: tells you the directory you are currently at.              

`mkdir`: It is used to create a directory/a new folder. e.g. 👇🏾:

```bash
$ mkdir pset
```

`cp`: It is used to copy a file/directory. It takes two arguments, the name of the file you want to copy and the destination you want to copy it to. e.g. `cp pset pset1`. This moves `pset` contents into `pset1`. You can use `-r` to copy an entire directory into another folder e.g. `cp -r pset pset1` moves the entire `pset` directory into `pset1`.

`rm`: used to remove a file/directory. To delete a particular file use `rm -f filename` where `-f` means force. To delete an entire directory use `rm -r directory`. You can also combine `-rf` to remove an entire directory forcibly (i.e. you wouldn’t be questioned).

`rmdir`: removes a directory.

# Scratch vs C comparison

A few comparisons between Scratch and C are shown👇🏾:

| **scratch** | **C** |
| --- | --- |
| Say “hello, world” | `printf(”hello,world\n”);` |
| When green flag clicked | `int.main(void){
}` |

`\n` - new line

`#include <studio.h>`- a declaration that the function exists from a primary code. Like a standardization.

# Comments

**Comments** are used to explain your code. They do not execute. The syntax for comments in C is `//`. E.g. 👇🏾:

```c
//This is where my code comes
```

# Operators

**Arithmetic operators** are used to perform mathematical operations. There are a few examples of arithmetic operators in C 👇🏾:

| Operator | Name | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | x + y |
| - | Subtraction | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | x * y |
| / | Division | x / y |
| % | Modulus | x % y |
| ++ | Increment | x++ |
| -- | Decrement | x-- |

There are also **comparison operators** which as the name implies, are used to compare values or variables 👇🏾:

| Operator | Name | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal to | x == y |
| != | Not equal | x != y |
| > | Greater than | x > y |
| < | Less than | x < y |
| >=  | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| <= | Less than or equal to | x <= y |

# Programs in C

## How to print `hello, world`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world \n");
}
```

## How to print out users input

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    string name = get_string ("What is your name? ");
    printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    string first = get_string ("What is your first name? ");
    string last = get_string ("What is your last name? ");
    printf("Hello, %s, %s\n", first,last);
}
```

`%` is a placeholder. A placeholder is something temporarily used as a substitute for something unknown or generic. 

`%s` denotes to strings; `%i` denotes to integers; `%f` denotes to floats; `%c` denotes to chars; `%d` denotes to whole numbers; `%li` denotes to longs; `%d` denotes to doubles.

`=` means assignment. It assigns a variable to the value on the right. In C a type of variable is stated before the variable e.g. `string`.

## What do you do if % is written as a text?

You will need to write a percentage symbol twice (`%%`) to demonstrate a percentage 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("I got 100%%\n");
}
```

## Conditionals

As stated in [Scratch](https://www.notion.so/Scratch-59a65bdda4fd4e6c80c3237c5eafd37e?pvs=21)  , **Conditionals** are statements or expressions that perform different actions based on whether a specific condition is True or False. 

Conditionals in C consist of `if`, `else if` and `else` which are used to compare different scenarios.
`if` and `else if` are used to compare two conditions i.e. if the previous condition is not True, test the next condition. The `else` keyword is used to capture anything which is not captured by previous conditions.

The first program prompts the user for `x` and `y` values and based on the users response outputs either `x is less than y` or `x is greater than y`👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    int x = get_int("What is x? ");
    int y = get_int("What is y? ");
    if (x < y)
    {
        printf("x is less than y\n");
    }
    else if
    {
        printf("x is greater than y\n");
    }
}
```

The second program prompts the user for `x` and `y` values and based on the users response outputs either `x is less than y` or `x is greater than y`. If neither, then the only possible outcome `x is equal to y`👇🏾:

```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    int x = get_int("What is x? ");
    int y = get_int("What is y? ");
    if (x < y)
    {
        printf("x is less than y\n");
    }
    else if (x > y)
    {
        printf("x is not less than y\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("x is equal to y\n");
    }
}
```

## Agreement

The program below prompts the user. If the user inputs `y` or `Y` when prompted, `Agreed` is outputted. `Else if` the user inputs `n` or `N`, `Disagreed` is outputted 👇🏾:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");
    if (c == 'y'||c == 'Y')
    {
        printf("Agreed.\n");
    }
    else if (c == 'n'||c == 'N')
    {
        printf("Disagreed.\n");
    }
}
```

![Output of the program based on different outcomes.](Screenshot_(257).png)

Output of the program based on different outcomes.

**Note that:**

`||` means “OR” 

`==` means equal to in C.

If you are dealing with anything with more than one character in C, use double quotes (””) but if you are dealing with a single character use a single quote (’’) so the computer knows it’s a `char` and not a `string` datatype.

## Loops and variables

A **variable** is basically a storage that changes its characters.

**Loops** are used in repetitions.

### Declaring a variable

The syntax to declare a variable in C is 👇🏾:

```c
datatype variableName = value;
```

Example 👇🏾:

```c
int counter = 3;
```

***You only need to state the type of variable (`int`, `char`, `string`) when declaring it and not when incrementing or decrementing.**

### Incrementing a variable

There are 3 ways to increment a variable in C 👇🏾:

```c
counter =  counter + 1; //method 1
counter += 1; //method 2
counter ++; //method 3
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    int counter = 0;
    while (counter < 3)
    {
        printf("Hello\n");
        counter ++;
    }
}
```

The program below is the performs just like the one above. In this case, `counter` is declared to be `1` and then iterates till it equals `3` (as the condition specifies). Printing `Hello` three times 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    int counter = 1;
    while (counter <= 3)
    {
        printf("Hello\n");
        counter ++;
    }
}
```

### Decrementing a variable

There are 3 ways to decrement a variable in C 👇🏾:

```c
counter =  counter - 1; //method 1
counter - -; // method 2
counter -= 1; // method 3
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
    int counter = 3;
    while (counter > 0)
    {
        printf("Hello\n");
        counter --;
    }
}
```

### Types of Loops

- `while` **loop**
    
    A `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    
    The program below just executes the code as long as `n` is not equal to `3`. That means it prints `Hello` 3 times because `n` increments from `0` then 1, then 2 👇🏾:
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <cs50.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        int n = 0;
        while(n < 3)
       {
        printf("Hello\n");
        n++;
       }
    }
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot (260).png](Screenshot_(260).png)
    
- `for` **loop**
    
    This is used when you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code. It takes everything within one line 👇🏾:
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <cs50.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        for (int counter = 0; counter < 3; counter ++)
        {
            printf("Hello\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This program outputs 👇🏾:
    
    ![Screenshot (259).png](Screenshot_(259).png)
    
- `Do while` **loop**
    
    `Do while` loop is similar to `while` loop but it will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
    
    The program prompts the user for a `size` in the form of a variable `n`. If the user inputs a number smaller than `1`, they are re-prompted. But if the user inputs a number above or equal to `1`, the program stops (they are not re-prompted). Note that the cs50 `get_int()` function just prompts the user for an integer 👇🏾:
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <cs50.h>
    int main(void)
    {
       int n;
       do
       {
        n = get_int ("size: ");
       }
       while(n < 1);
    }
    ```
    
- **Infinite loop**
    
    Infinite loop is not actual a type of loop but like the name suggests, this is used to loop infinitely 👇🏾:
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <cs50.h>
    int main(void)
    {
       while (true)
        {
            printf("Hello\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    
    `while` expresses Boolean and in this case `true` is never going to change to `false` so it keeps going forever. `0` is represented as `false` but any other integer greater than `0` is represented as `true` 👇🏾:
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <cs50.h>
    int main(void)
    {
       while (1)
        {
            printf("Hello\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    

## Separating `\n` from first print

You can separate `\n` (new line) from the first `printf ("Hello")` in order to output `Hello` in one row not more but also creating a new line after that 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
   for (int i = 0 ; i < 3; i ++)
    {
        printf("Hello ");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

## Printing 3 rows with 3 columns

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
   for (int row = 0 ; row < 3; row ++)
    {
        for (int col = 0; col < 3; col ++)
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

```

The output of this program is 👇🏾:

![Screenshot (263).png](Screenshot_(263).png)

You can simplify this by using a variable to represent the number of rows and columns you want in the loop 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
   int n = 3;
   for (int row = 0 ; row < n; row ++)
    {
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col ++)
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

## Using const

`const` is used to strengthen a code, to make sure a variable isn’t changed. You can’t write code elsewhere to overwrite the code written with `const`. In our previous example, using `const` just solidifies n making sure the value cannot be overwritten elsewhere in the program 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
   const int n = 3;
   for (int row = 0 ; row < n; row ++)
    {
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col ++)
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

## Using cs50’s `get_int` function with rows and columns

The `get_int()` CS50 function just prompts the user for an integer. In the example below, `get_int()` is used to prompt the user for an integer and whatever number the user types, the rows and columns are outputted accordingly 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(void)
{
   int n = get_int ("size: ");
   for (int row = 0 ; row < n; row ++)
   {
    for (int col = 0; col < n; col ++)
    {
        printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
   }
}
```

This presents an output based on the users response 👇🏾:

![Here, the user typed in `5` when prompted and got hashes with 5 rows and 5 columns.](Hash_output_2_C.png)

Here, the user typed in `5` when prompted and got hashes with 5 rows and 5 columns.

## Defining functions for our previous example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int get_size (void);
void print_grid (int n);
int main (void)
{
    int n = get_size();
    print_grid(n);
}

int get_size (void)
{
    int n;
    do
    {
        n = get_int("size: ");
    }
    while (n < 1);
    return n;
}
void print_grid (int n)
{
    for (int row = 0; row < n; row++)
    {
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++)
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

Two new functions were created (`get_size` and `print_grid`) and we later stated how they should react. The statement `int get_size (void)` means the output is an integer but the input is void while `void print_grid (int n)` means the input is the variable `n` and the output is void. 

***The first lines of each function also have to be included at the top of the code with semicolons.**

## Addition in C, Integer overflow, Floating point imprecision

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int x = get_int("x: ");
    int y = get_int("y: ");

    printf("%i\n", x + y);
}
```

Some problems wouldn’t be as straightforward however, due to the RAM in our computer only being able to store a finite amount. Computers use 32 bits to represent numbers therefore the maximum number a computer can represent is 4294967295 (negative and positive numbers).

This leads to **integer overflow** (a situation where you want to use more bits than the system can produce). C makes use of `long` datatype (64 bits) to solve the integer overflow situation whose placeholder is written as `%li` (long integer)👇🏾:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    long x = get_long("x: ");
    long y = get_long("y: ");

    printf("%li\n", x + y);
}
```

When you are doing math involving floating point values, you might lose everything after the decimal point. This can be fixed with a feature called **typecasting** (basically indicating to your compiler that you need to convert one datatype to another)👇🏾:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    long x = get_long("x: ");
    long y = get_long("y: ");

    float z = (float) x / (float) y;

    printf("%.2f\n", z);
}
```

`(float)` here tells the compiler that the result should be in a `float` format. `.2` indicates that the result should be round off to 2 D.P.

**Floating point imprecision** is where the computer is not very precise due to it’s finite number of bits. You can ask your system to round off a code to a number as large as lets say 20 places and the system brings out an unexpected result. This can be improved, but not fixed by replacing `float` with `double` (uses twice as many bits as a `float`).
