# Algorithms

## Intro
As stated in [scratch](/CS50x-Dano-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-by-Dano-Martin/1.scratch.md), an algorithm is a step by step instructions for solving problems.

## Pseudocode
Before writing code, we need an algorithm to determine how that code will work. You can begin writing it in the form of a **pseudocode**. Below are examples of pseudocode algorithms to search for the number 50 behind a door 👇🏾:

### Linear Search
In linear search, the idea of the algorithm is to iterate across an array from left to right, searching for a specified element.
```text
For each door from left to right

    if 50 is behind door

        return true

return false
```
Linear search can be used when there isn’t a large amount of items in an array to go through. The code above goes through all the doors till it finds the variable we are looking for.

### Binary Search
```text
if no doors left 

    return false;

if 50 is behind doors[middle] 

    return true

Else if 50 < doors[middle]

    search doors[0] through doors[middle - 1]

Else if 50 > doors[middle]

    search doors[middle + 1] through doors[n - 1]
```
The pseudocode above represents a search program algorithm where we are looking for the number 50 so we begin from the middle. 

- If the number at the middle is 50, we stop.
- Otherwise, if the number at the middle is greater than 50, we once again divide the numbers at the left of that number before searching from the middle. We repeat the process till we find 50.
- Otherwise, if the number at the middle is less than 50, we once again divide the numbers at the right of that number before searching from the middle. We repeat the process till we find 50.

**N/B:** The explanation above assumes the numbers are sorted in ascending order.

**N/B:** `[n-1]` just represents the last number in an array.

## Complexity of Algorithms
**$O$,** $\Omega$, $\theta$ allow you to describe the order of an algorithms running time. They are measures of how good or bad algorithms can be. They are all used to describe what makes one algorithm better than another.

The symbol $O$ is denoted when referring to the **worst-case** scenario/ upper hand. Below are $O$ types from worst to best 👇🏾:

$$O(n^2)$$ $$O(nlogn)$$ $$O(n)$$ $$O(logn)$$ $$O(1)$$

 $\Omega$  is also used to describe how few the steps of an algorithm are. It is denoted when referring to the best case scenario and is the lower hand 👇🏾:

 $$\Omega(n^2)$$ $$\Omega(nlogn)$$ $$\Omega(n)$$ $$\Omega(logn)$$ $$\Omega(1)$$

 $\theta$ is a coincidence in upper and lower hand, it describes if they are the same. E.g. counting everyone in a room is always going to take n steps both in the best and worst case scenario i.e. $\theta$ of n 👇🏾:
$$\theta(n^2)$$ $$\theta(nlogn)$$ $$\theta(n)$$ $$\theta(logn)$$ $$\theta(1)$$

### Complexity Code Examples
In the example 👇🏾:
```c
for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
{

}
```
The body of a loop runs in constant time. Therefore, the worst case runtime of this for loop that runs from `j` to `m` is  $O(m)$.

```c
for (int j = 0; j < p; j++)
{
    for (int k = 0; k < p; k++)
    {
    
    }
}
```
In the code above, there’s an outer loop that runs `p` times and an inner loop that also runs p times. Therefore, the worst case runtime of the code is $O(P^2)$.

## Programs
### Linear Code Translation
The program consists of an array of `numbers` whereby the user is prompted for a specific number. Once the user inputs a number, the array is looped in a linear manner to find the number. If it’s in the array, `Found` is printed. Otherwise, `Not found` 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main (void)
{
    int numbers[] = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int search = get_int("Number: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
    {
        if (numbers[i] == search)
        {
            printf("Found\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("Not found\n");
    return 1;
}
```
### Finding a String in an Array
The program below prompts the user for a name using `text`. It then uses a loop and `strcmp()` to compare every character of the text typed by the user with the characters of the items in the array `names`.
The line `if (strcmp(names[i], text) == 0)` just compares characters in the array indexes `names[i]` with the characters in the variable `text` and  `== 0`  is like saying the characters are equal 👇🏾:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main (void)
{
    string names[] = {"Ana", "Lucia", "Jerome"};
    string text = get_string("Name: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        if (strcmp(names[i], text) == 0)
        {
            printf("Found\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("Not found\n");
    return 1;
}
```
### Using an array input to output a corresponding array
The program below prompts the user for a name using `text` . In a loop, it uses `strcmp()` to compare the text with the items in the array `names[]` like in the previous example. If there’s a match, the corresponding number will be printed 👇🏾:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main (void)
{
    string names[] = {"Ana", "Lucia"};
    string numbers[] = {"+2348023332764", "+234812849302"};
    string text = get_string("Name: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    {
        if (strcmp(names[i], text) == 0)
        {
            printf("%s\n", numbers[i]);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("Not found\n");
    return 1;
}
```
Its output can be 👇🏾:

### Storing a lot of Data
Storing two different arrays like done previously is liable to lead to some errors at some point when storing large amount of data. This can be solved by creating your own datatype in what will look like 👇🏾:
```c
typedef struct
{
string name;
string number;
}
person;
```
typedef defines what type of data we you are storing, struct indicates the structure that has multiple values within it, person in this case is the name of the type (can be whatever the programmer wants to call it). The code will look like 👇🏾:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct
{
    string name;
    string number;
}
person;

int main (void)
{
    person people[2];
    people[0].name = "Ana";
    people[0].number = "+2348023332764";

    people[1].name = "Lucia";
    people[1].number = "+234812849302";

    string search = get_string("Text: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    {
        if (strcmp(people[i].name, search) == 0)
        {
            printf("%s\n", people[i].number);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("Not found\n");
    return 1;
}
```
To do this with less lines, you will have to store them in files or spreadsheets which will be looked at later.

## Sorting
**Sorting** is basically ordering data in an increasing or decreasing manner according to some linear relationships among the data items.

The input is usually the unsorted data - can be numbers, letters etc. and the output will be that same data in a sorted format.
![Unsorted input and sorted output](/sorting.jpg)
There are different types of sorting 👇🏾:

### Selection Sort
In **selection sort**, the idea of the algorithm is to find the smallest unsorted element and add it to the end of the sorted list.

This in pseudocode will be 👇🏾:
```plain text
for i from 0 to n-1

    find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
    
    swap smallest numbers with numbers[i]
```
In this pseudocode, we will go round all the items in the arrays in loops and sort the `numbers[i]` ascendingly based on if the number beside it is smaller, it goes in front of it.

In selection sorting, you need to look at the comparisons. E.g. if you are sorting n numbers: 1, 0, 4, 3, you have 3 (n-1) comparisons to find the smallest number. To find the 2nd smallest number it will take you 2 steps, which is (n-2). To find the 3rd smallest number it will take you 1 step which is (n-3). These can all be shortened to $n(n-1)/2$ which is $(n^2-n)/2$ and this means the efficiency is $O(n^2)$ in the worst case scenario. In the best case (where the list is already sorted), its efficiency is $\Omega(n^2)$.

### Bubble Sort
Another approach to sorting arrays. The main idea of **bubble sort** is to move higher value elements generally towards the right and lower value elements generally towards the left. It involves incrementally solving problems.

Its pseudocode will look like 👇🏾:
```text
Repeat n times

for i from 0 to n-2

if numbers[i] and numbers[i + 1] out of order

    swap them
```
The worst case scenario will be $O(n^2)$.

### Merge Sort
The **merge sort** involves sorting the smallest numbers in each halves, then comparing the largest of those with the remaining numbers in the opposite half till you find a number that is bigger than it. Repeat the sequence 👇🏾:
```c
If only one number

    Quit

Else 

    Sort the left half of numbers

    Sort the right half of numbers

    Merge sorted halves
```

The upper bound of this method is $O(nlogn)$ , the lower bound is $\Omega(nlogn)$ .
 **Disadvantage:** Merge sort uses more space than bubble or selection sort.

 ## Recursion
 **Recursion** is the ability of a function to recall itself. The function calls itself on smaller problems so eventually there’s no more problem to solve. E.g. in a pseudocode implementing a search algorithm, you write a pseudocode to search the right and left. That is recursive.

The code below prints the height inputted by the user by reducing the row `n` by one then adding a column `i` which is less than `n` to make up the last row. Therefore, there’s a recursion in how we add additional layers 👇🏾:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

void draw(int n);
int main(void)
{
    int height = get_int("Height: ");
    draw(height);
}
void draw(int n)
{
    if (n <= 0)
    {
        return;
    }
    draw (n - 1);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

### Use
If you can find a problem that is used in a smaller problem and can be solved in the same way then recursion is a good idea. Example factorials:
The factorial(!) of $1$ is $1$, the factorial of $2$ is $2 * 1$ which is the same as $2 * 1!$, the factorial of $3$ is $3 * 2 * 1$ which is also the same as $3 * 2!$ and so it goes on.

**N/B:** Base case is the problem we know how to solve. We don’t need to break it down.
