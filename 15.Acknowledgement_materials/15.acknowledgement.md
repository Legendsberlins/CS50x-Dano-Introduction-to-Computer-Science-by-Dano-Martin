I was first introduced to Harvard's cs50 course on social media and couldn’t believe it was offered for free so I just decided to bookmark it. A while later, I looked it up and decided to take it. I can assure you the moment I began this course, I was completely revamped - more confident and I began to see why Harvard is regarded as such a prestigious University.
I would like to thank everyone in the CS50 crew - Mr. David Mayan - you have been my biggest inspiration in this field, Mr. Carter Zenke who basically made me grasp things I couldn't understand during the lectures, Mr.
Doug Lloyd who explained the shorts perfectly, Mr. Brian Yu who worked so hard to simplity the problem sets and labs. Of course, I have missed those who play big roles behind the scenes but thank you for everything. You all changed my life❤️.
