# Memory

## Bitmap, RBG and Hexadecimal

### Bitmap
A bitmap is the representation of pixels with bits e.g.
![Bitmap representation](/bitmap.png)
In the image above, 1 represents the white (⚪) pixels and 0 represents the black (⚫) pixels.

### RBG and Hexadecimal
Image colors in a computer are stored in RGB (red, blue and green) variables, with each R, G, B value consisting of 0-255 options which is 8 bits/1 byte. 

This can also be represented in base 16(hexadecimal format) where 10-15 is represented as A-F. E.g. the hexadecimal values of a blue can be represented as #0000FF which means R = 00; G = 00; B = 255.
$$ FF $$ $$ 16^1 * F + 16^0 * F $$ $$ 16 * 15 + 1 * 15 $$ $$ 240 + 15 $$ $$ = 255 $$

**N/B:** 16 in hexadecimal is represented by 10. 17 is represented by 11 and so on.

Hexadecimal is represented by 4 bits i.e. F in hexadecimal is 15 in decimal which is 1111 in binary. Hexadecimal is used to map addresses in a computers memory because it’s a bit tedious to map with binary👇🏾:

There’s a bit of an ambiguity in this format of storing data in a memory as another user may feel the value  10 represents 10 not 1 and 0. A way to fix that will be by including 0 x before every number with the x implying that the digits after are in hexadecimal👇🏾:

## Memory
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    printf("%i\n", n);
}
```
If you write a code like the above, it’s stored in your memory like👇🏾:

### Memory Operators
#### Ampersand(`&`)
We use the ampersand (`&`) operator to get the address of a piece of data in memory. It works when you put ampersand before the name of a variable.

In the program below, `%p` allows you to print the address of a variable if `&` is mentioned before the variable, in this case `n`. In this example, an address e.g.`0x7ffcfa7131ac` is outputted in the terminal as the address where `n = 50` is stored in your memory.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    printf("%p\n", &n);
}
```
#### `*`
We use the * operator to go to a specific address. It’s basically a dereference operator i.e. it goes to “the reference” and accesses the data at that memory, allowing you to manipulate it at will.

## Pointer
A pointer is an address to a location in memory where a variable lives.
![Pointer](/pointer.png)
In the image above, `*p` takes a pointer `p` and goes to the address stored in `p` which contains the calls variable.
In the program below, we created a variable called `p` and gave it a pointer `*`. We then went to the address `*p` and stored the address of a variable `n` i.e. `&n` inside it and we printed the address of variable `p`. An address of a memory is an integer so it’s represented by datatype `int` 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    int *p = &n;
    printf("%p\n", p);
}
```
The output is 👇🏾:
![Pointer code](/Pointer_program.png)

Pointers take up 8 bytes👇🏾:
![Pointer third representation](/pointer_3.png)

You can think of a pointer as a variable that points to something else. Using `p`, you can get to the value `n`. The pointer directs you to the address of another variable in this case, `n` which has a certain value, in this case `50` 👇🏾:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    int *p = &n;
    printf("%i\n", *p);
}
```  
In contrast to the previous example, this example uses `*` to go to the address that contains the variable `p` and prints the integer in that address, `50`.
Another code explaining pointers👇🏾: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 28;
    int b = 50;
    int *c = &a;

    *c = 14;
    c = &b;
    *c = 25;

    printf("a has value %i and address %p\n", a, &a);
    printf("b has value %i and address %p\n", b, &b);
    printf("c has value %p and address %p\n", c, &c);
 }
```
This outputs👇🏾:
![Pointer second code](/pointer_4.png)
Basically, we stored 28 and 50 in variables a and b. We then created a pointer which stores &a (the address of a), we changed the value in the pointer *c to 14 which therefore changes the value of a to 14. We also changed the variable c to be the address of &b and then changed the value of the pointer *c to 25, therefore changing the value of b to 25.
