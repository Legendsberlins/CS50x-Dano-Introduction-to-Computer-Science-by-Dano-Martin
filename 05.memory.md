# Memory

# Bitmap, RGB and Hexadecimal

## Bitmap

A bitmap is the representation of pixels with bits e.g.

![In the image above, 1 represents the white (⚪) pixels and 0 represents the black (⚫) pixels.](screenshot_bitmap.png)

In the image above, 1 represents the white (⚪) pixels and 0 represents the black (⚫) pixels.

## RGB & Hexadecimal

Image colors in a computer are stored in RGB (red, blue and green) variables, with each R, G, B value consisting of 0-255 options which is 8 bits/1 byte. 

This can also be represented in base 16(hexadecimal format) where 10-15 is represented as A-F. E.g. the hexadecimal values of a blue can be represented as #0000FF which means R = 00; G = 00; B = 255.

$$
FF \\ 16^1*F + 16^0*F \\ 16*15+1*15 \\ 240+15 \\ =255
$$

**N/B:** 16 in hexadecimal is represented by 10. 17 is represented by 11 and so on.

Hexadecimal is represented by 4 bits i.e. F in hexadecimal is 15 in decimal which is 1111 in binary. Hexadecimal is used to map addresses in a computers memory because it’s a bit tedious to map with binary👇🏾:

There’s a bit of an ambiguity in this format of storing data in a memory as another user may feel the value  10 represents 10 not 1 and 0. A way to fix that will be by including 0 x before every number with the x implying that the digits after are in hexadecimal👇🏾:

# Memory

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    printf("%i\n", n);
}
```

If you write a code like the above, it’s stored in your memory like👇🏾:

![Screenshot (49).png](Screenshot_(49).png)

## Memory Operators

### Ampersand(`&`)

We use the ampersand (`&`) operator to get the address of a piece of data in memory. It works when you put ampersand before the name of a variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    printf("%p\n", &n);
}
```

### *

We use the `*` operator to go to a specific address. It’s basically a **dereference operator** i.e. it goes to “the reference” and accesses the data at that memory, allowing you to manipulate it at will.

# Pointer

A **pointer** is an address to a location in memory where a variable lives.

![`*p` takes a pointer `p` and goes to the address stored in `p` which contains the `calls` variable.](Screenshot_(62).png)

`*p` takes a pointer `p` and goes to the address stored in `p` which contains the `calls` variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    int *p = &n;
    printf("%p\n", p);
}
```

![Screenshot (50).png](Screenshot_(50).png)

Pointers take up 8 bytes👇🏾:

![Screenshot (51).png](Screenshot_(51).png)

You can think of a pointer as a variable that points to something else. Using `p`, you can get to the value `n`. The pointer directs you to the address of another variable in this case, `n` which has a certain value, in this case `50` 👇🏾:  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    int *p = &n;
    printf("%i\n", *p);
}
```

Another code explaining pointers👇🏾: 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 28;
    int b = 50;
    int *c = &a;

    *c = 14;
    c = &b;
    *c = 25;

    printf("a has value %i and address %p\n", a, &a);
    printf("b has value %i and address %p\n", b, &b);
    printf("c has value %p and address %p\n", c, &c);
 }
```

This outputs👇🏾:

```bash
a has a value 14 and address 0x755ea79fce9c
b has a value 25 and address 0x755ea79fce98
c has a value 0x755ea79fce98 and address 0x755ea79fce90
```

Basically, we stored `28` and `50` in variables `a` and `b`. We then created a pointer which stores `&a` (the address of `a`), we changed the value in the pointer `*c` to `14` which therefore changes the value of `a` to `14`. We also changed the variable `c` to be the address of `&b` and then changed the value of the pointer `*c` to `25`, therefore changing the value of `b` to `25`.

## Representing strings

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    string s = "HI!";
    printf("%s\n", s);
}
```

![Screenshot (52).png](Screenshot_(52).png)

When storing strings, the memory also stores the names of variables, in this case `s`. It stores `s` in the same address it stores the first character of the string at. This is how you would know if a string goes to a particular variable when looking at the memory. Also, strings usually end with \0 (**nul**) in memory unlike other datatypes.

In the image above, you can think of `s` also as a pointer to the character “**H**”. Therefore it can also be written as `char*` as shown below👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%s\n", s);
}
```

If we want to get the address of a character in the string, we use `&` to specify that it’s an address we need👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%p\n", &s[0]);
}
```

The example below shows that the address of the entire string is the same as the address of the first character but the addresses of other characters differ👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%p\n", s);
    printf("%p\n", &s[0]);
    printf("%p\n", &s[1]);
    printf("%p\n", &s[2]);
}
```

This outputs👇🏾:

```bash
0x55ee045d5004
0x55ee045d5004
0x55ee045d5005
0x55ee045d5006
```

## Pointer arithmetic

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%c\n", s[0]);
    printf("%c\n", s[1]);
    printf("%c\n", s[2]);
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%c\n", *s);
    printf("%c\n", *(s+1));
    printf("%c\n", *(s+2));
}
```

This prints out the characters contained in the address in `s` accordingly.

A **segmentation fault error** can output in your prompt if you poke around unreachable data in an array in your computers memory. E.g.👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%c\n", *s);
    printf("%c\n", *(s+1));
    printf("%c\n", *(s+50000));
}
```

This may return a **segmentation fault error** depending on what is reachable in the computers memory. This is also how hackers can get a hold of a users data.

## Substrings

A string is a sequence of characters identified by its first byte.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%s\n", s);
    printf("%s\n", s+1);
    printf("%s\n", s+2);
}
```

This outputs👇🏾:

```bash
HI!
I!
!
```

## Strcmp

We don’t compare strings using `==` like we do for integers because strings will compare the memory address which will never be equal. Imagine the code below👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("S: ");
    char *t = get_string("T: ");
    if (s == t)
    {
        printf("Same\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Different\n");
    }
 }
```

This will always output as “Different” because `s` and `t` variables are stored in different addresses.

![Image shows that `s` and `t` are in different addresses.](Screenshot_(53).png)

Image shows that `s` and `t` are in different addresses.

This is fixed using the `strcmp` function which carries them to their actual variables, starts comparing them from left to right and stops once it hits the **nul👇🏾:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("S: ");
    char *t = get_string("T: ");
    if (strcmp(s, t) == 0)
    {
        printf("Same\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Different\n");
    }
 }
```

## Strings assignment pedagogy

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("S: ");
    char *t = s;
    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }
    printf("S: %s\n", s);
    printf("T: %s\n", t);
 }
```

If we output this we will get 👇🏾:

```bash
S: hi!
S: HI!
T: HI!
```

The programmer would expect the second `S` to print out as `hi` not `HI`. This doesn’t happen because when we assign a string variable to another variable, it just copies its memory inside the original variables memory and what ever happens to its contents also happens to the original variables contents as shown 👇🏾:

![Screenshot (54).png](Screenshot_(54).png)

![Screenshot (55).png](Screenshot_(55).png)

We can use 2 functions to fix this:

### Malloc

Malloc is for memory allocation. You can use it to ask the OS for a particular number of bytes of memory and it will return the first free byte of memory address it finds. It doesn’t make use of a **nul** so if you ask it for a particular amount of byte, you have to note it.

The prototypes for malloc and free are in the `<stdlib.h>` library. The code below outputs👇🏾:

```c
S: hi!
S: hi!
T: Hi!
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("S: ");
    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1); //+ 1 for nul as malloc doesn't include nul

    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n + 1; i++)
    {
        t[i] = s[i];
    }
    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }
    printf("S: %s\n", s);
    printf("T: %s\n", t);
 }
```

We assigned the malloc function to `string t`, asking the computer to find bytes in its memory for us  - we included an additional byte as malloc doesn’t automatically include the **nul** character. We then used a loop to run through every character in this string array before we wrote a code to convert the first character of `t` to uppercase if the length of `t > 0`. 

![How the code above stores the variables in memory.](Screenshot_(57).png)

How the code above stores the variables in memory.

You can use the function called strcpy to shorten the for loop section of the code above👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("S: ");
    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);

    strcpy (t , s);
    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }
    printf("S: %s\n", s);
    printf("T: %s\n", t);
```

### Free

`free` function is the opposite of `malloc`. When you are done with a particular byte of memory you can free it by passing down its address to the OS.

If your computer has ever frozen or hung, this might be caused by you not freeing up the memories you write your program with. The computer may still have free memories but the programmer is just using too much of it without freeing up any. 

When you close the program you are using the memory frees automatically, but if you leave the program to run a long time, you will need to free up space.

You free the data you collected after all the code👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("S: ");
    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);

    strcpy (t , s);
    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }
    printf("S: %s\n", s);
    printf("T: %s\n", t);
		free(t);
}
```

You do not need to free data from premade libraries like `get_string` as the libraries already come with functions to do that.

# Null

Functions like `get_string` and `malloc` return a value called **null.** This is an address of 0 in the memory which shouldn’t contain any data.

If for example, the user types a lot of characters in his string that the computer doesn’t have enough memory to process, the function `get_string` returns **null**.

In `malloc`, if the programmer asks for way too much memory the `malloc` function will also return **null.** It can be fixed with a conditional 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("S: ");
    if (s == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);
    if (t == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    strcpy (t , s);
    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }
    printf("S: %s\n", s);
    printf("T: %s\n", t);
	
		return 0;
 }
```

This just says that if the variables ever go beyond reach i.e. if they output null, then the system should `return` a number to specify an error.

# Valgrind

Valgrind is a debug program which looks at your code and finds errors. We use `valgrind ./filename` to execute the valgrind program on your code. 

Imagine the code 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int *x = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    x[1] = 72;
    x[2] = 73;
    x[3] = 74;
 }
```

**This code will have 2 problems: an index problem (starting from `[1]` not `[0]`) and a freeing memory problem. It can be solved as 👇🏾:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int *x = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (x == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    x[0] = 72;
    x[1] = 73;
    x[2] = 74;

    free(x);
    return 0;
 }
```

# Random outputs

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int *x;
    int *y;
    x = malloc(sizeof(int));

    *x = 49;
    *y = 13;

    y = x;
		printf("%i\n", *x);
    printf("%i\n", *y);

 }
```

**The code above will not work. It will likely output random numbers to `y` because we assigned a value to its memory before actually creating space for it. It can be fixed as 👇🏾:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int *x;
    int *y;
    x = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    y = x;

    *x = 49;
    *y = 13;
		printf("%i\n", *x);
    printf("%i\n", *y);

 }
```

![Screenshot (58).png](Screenshot_(58).png)

# Swap

In the code below, we swap the value of `x` and `y` and print them out👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <cs50.h>

void swap (int *a, int *b);

int main(void)
{
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;
    printf("x is %i and y is %i\n",x,y);
    swap(&x , &y);
    printf("x is %i and y is %i\n",x,y);
 }
 void swap (int *a, int *b)
 {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
 }
```

In order to swap, you can use use an extra variable to ease the process. In here, temp takes the value of `*a(1)`, `*a(1)` , then takes the value of `*b(2)` and `*b(2`) takes the value of `temp(1)`. The line `swap(&x , &y)` just makes sure the arguments in swap `(int **a , int *b)`* go to the addresses `&x` and `&y` and point to their values.

## Memory Components

**Machine code** - when you double click or open a program, you are loading the machine code into the computers memory from the computers hard-drive. It is put up top in the memory which is how the CPU gets a hold of it quickly.

**Global** - this just specifies the global variables(variables at the top of a program) declared in a program.

**Heap** - is where the function `malloc` gets memory from. It’s basically an empty space without data. `malloc` keeps track of the bytes it’s been allocated from heap. It grows the more you get memory from it.

**Stack** -  it grows upward. It’s where functions have variables and arguments stored.

![Screenshot (59).png](Screenshot_(59).png)

Programs can crash if you call too many functions or take up a large amount of space as shown. This is why the `return` function is used in the **NULL** conditional.

![Screenshot (61).png](Screenshot_(61).png)

This is how functions are stored in the stack section. In C, it starts with the main function then goes upwards to the other functions called in the main function.

**Heap overflow:** is when the heap is overflowed and memory that should not be touched is touched down. 

**Stack overflow:** is when the stack is overflowed and memory that should not be touched is touched up. 

**Buffer overflow:** is when the memory the computer uses to store data back to back is surpassed. 

# Replacing `<cs50.h>` with `<stdio.h>`

The code below replaces the `get` functions. We used `printf(”X: “)` first of all to code the form where the user will input his value. We then used `scanf` basically asking our program to scan and makes sure our user types in an integer and tells the program where to put the users cursor using `&x`. Lastly, we used `printf(”X: %i\n”,x)` to print the output.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   int x;
   printf("X: ");
   scanf("%i", &x);
   printf("X: %i\n", x);

 }
```

To do this with strings, you can make use of arrays which can also serve as pointers 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   char *s[4];
   printf("X: ");
   scanf("%s", s);
   printf("X: %s\n", s)

 }
```

This may not be suitable as the user can type in input larger than the array we set. It can be improved by creating a loop using the `malloc` function to ask for more space whenever the user types in data.

# File pointers

## **Types of file pointer functions**

**fopen**: opens a file and returns a file pointer to it. It takes two arguments, `filename` and action to be taken  like `"a"`(append), `"w"`(write), `"r"`(read). The difference between `"a"` and `"w"` is that `"w"` overwrites a file if that file already exists, while `"a"` continues from where the file stopped previously. You will always need to check the return value to make sure you don’t get back to NULL when using `fopen`. An example is 👇🏾:

```c
FILE *ptr = fopen(filename , "r");
    //Check if file exists
    if (file == NULL)
    {
        printf("No such file\n");
        return 1;
    }
```

**fclose:** to close the file pointed to by the given file pointer. An example is 👇🏾:

```c
fclose(ptr);
```

**fgetc**: reads and returns the next character from the file pointed to or the first character from the file if this is the first time we open the file. The operation of the file passed in as an argument must be `“r”` for this to work 👇🏾:

```c
char ch = fgetc(ptr);
```

This function can be used in a loop to read then print out every character in a file which is what the linux command `cat` does. This loop just reads the first character, compares it to the `EOF` (End of File) character and keeps printing the characters if they don’t match.

```c
char ch;
while ((ch = fgetc(ptr)) != EOF)
	printf("%c", ch);
```

**fputc**: allows one to write a single character to a file. It only takes the operations `“a”` and `“w”` from the original pointer. It takes 2 arguments; character and file pointer 👇🏾:

```c
fputc('A', ptr);
```

We can substitute `printf` with `fputc` from our previous example to replicate the linux `cp` command:

```c
char ch;
while ((ch = fgetc(ptr)) != EOF)
	fputc(ch , ptr);
```

**fread**: it’s an advanced version of `fgetc` that allows one to get any amount of information and stores them in memory in a buffer. It has 4 arguments; a pointer to the location it will be stored (buffer),  the size of one block (in bytes) in a buffer, how many blocks the programmer wants to use and the pointer they read from. Example below 👇🏾:

```c
fread(buffer, 1, 3 ptr);
```

Another example 👇🏾:

```c
int arr[10];
fread(arr, sizeof(int), 10, ptr)
```

![Screenshot (63).png](Screenshot_(63).png)

The pointer `arr` can also be replaced with a variable but we will have to use `&` to specify it’s a variable 👇🏾:

```c
char c;
fread(&c , sizeof(char), 1, ptr)
```

**fwrite**: is the opposite of `fread` and only accepts operators “w” or “a”. It has 4 arguments like `fread`; a pointer to the location it will be stored (buffer),  the size of one block (in bytes) in a buffer, how many blocks the programmer wants to use and the pointer they read from 👇🏾:

```c
int arr[10];
fwrite(arr, sizeof(int), 10, ptr)
```

**fprintf:** is a function that not just prints to a screen but to a file 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    FILE *file = fopen("phonebook.csv", "a");
    string name = get_string("Name: ");
    string number = get_string("Number: ");

   fprintf(file, "%s %s\n",name, number);
   fclose(file);

 }
```

**ferror**: Indicates if an error has occurred when working with a file.

**feof**: tells you whether you have read till the end of the file.

**ftell**: tells you at what byte (position) you are at within the file.

**fseek**: allows you rewind or fast-forward within a file.

**fgets**: reads a full string from a file.

**fputs**: writes a full string to a file.

**N/B**: An array is a pointer to it’s first item.

## PDF exercise

**Create a program, pdf.c, that checks whether a file passed in as a command line argument, is a pdf. All pdfs will begin with a 4 byte sequence corresponding to these integers, 37, 80, 68, 70. (These integers are just used to specify what type of file you are using, in this case pdf).**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
    //Prompt error if there's no file name or they are multiple file names
    if (argc != 2)
    {
        printf("Improper usage\n");
        return 1;
    }
    //Open file
    string filename = argv[1];
    FILE *file = fopen(filename , "r");
    //Check if file exists
    if (file == NULL)
    {
        printf("No such file\n");
        return 1;
    }
    uint8_t buffer[4];
    fread(buffer, 1, 4, file);
    for (int i = 0; i < buffer[i]; i++)
    {
        printf("%i\n", buffer[i]);
				fclose(file);
    }
    printf("\n");
		fclose(file);
 }
```

`uint8_t` is used so the buffer stores the same kind of data you have in your files. pdf stores a special type called `uint8_t`. `U` means unsigned integers (integers that are only positive). `8` means it’s only 8 bits(1byte) and `t` specifies the type. 

***Always use `fclose` after using `fopen`.**
