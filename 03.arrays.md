# Arrays

# Intro

An **array** is a way of storing your data in the form of a list so you can access the data easily. It’s used to store multiple values in a single variable.

# Compilers

A **compiler** is a program whose job is to convert source code to machine code. There are compilers like clang, gcc etc.

`make` command doesn’t compile but it automates the process of using an actual compiler. You can use these compilers directly. The commands below compiled the `hello.c` file into an executable named `a.out` using clang compiler. `a.out` is then run in command to print hello, world which is the output of the code in the `hello.c` file. Finally,  `a.out` executable is renamed to `hello`👇🏾:

```bash
$ clang hello.c 
$ ./a.out
$ hello, world
$ mv a.out hello
```

This contains a bit too many steps but that can be improved with the use of a command line argument.

## **Command-Line Arguments**

A **Command Line Argument** is a word or key phrase you type after a command that modifies the behavior of the command.

```bash
$ clang -o hello hello.c
$ ./hello
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    //prompt for user name
    string name = get_string("What is your name? ");
    printf("Hello, %s\n", name);
}
```

If you use the `clang -o hello hello.c` command on this code, it doesn’t work because you will need to input a different command in order for `cs50.h` or any 3rd party library to get your program to use those 0’s and 1’s the computer understands. `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50` should be used instead. The `l` links the 0’s and 1’s to your code.

Command line arguments can also simplify our code e.g. `argv` (all the arguments typed out) and `argc`(the count of the arguments). If you want to know how many arguments the user typed out on the prompt, you need the array of the arguments (`argv`) together with the count (`argc`). Example 👇🏾;

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main (int argc, string argv[])
{
    printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
}
```

When running the command `$ make codename \\ $ codename yourname`, the output of the code above will be `hello, yourname`. If you change the `[1]` to `[0]`, the output will be `hello, codename`. Therefore, the `codename` is the first command-line argument i.e. `argv[0]`.

You can also do more. In this example, there’s a condition. If the count on your prompt is equal to `2` then it runs `Hello +` the second argument i.e. `[1]`. But if it is less than or greater than `2`, it just runs the generic text `Hello, world`👇🏾:

```c
int main (int argc, string argv[])
{
    if (argc == 2)
    {
        printf("Hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Hello, world\n");
    }
}
```

## Stages of compiling

There are 4 stages taken when compiling code 👇🏾:

**Preprocessing**: it just shows that some code should be processed/analyzed before another code. e.g. the lines with syntax `#include` display different libraries and should be processed before the other lines. It works because there’s a folder (/usr/include) on your hard drive or cloud which contains these libraries. So what clang does is look for any `#include` syntax, it checks the usr/include directory for the name of the file in the bracket `<>`, then copies and pastes its contents without being visible. 

**Compiling**: the compiler compiles code to assembly language which is the closest language the computer understands.

**Assembling**: this is the way code converts into machine code (0’s and 1’s).

**Linking:** involves linking the source code of the user and also the entire code of the libraries in machine code (0’s and 1’s).

When a code is compiled, its structure isn’t exactly the same in machine code i.e. it wouldn’t use your source code variable names, it uses the same machine code to represent different parts of your code. So it would be quite difficult to decompile it from machine code back to source code.

# `int main(void)`

As we have seen, `void` can be replaced with arguments `argv argc`. Therefore, `void` just means that there are no arguments. `int` represents an integer. It tells you that the system will always output an integer even if you don’t ask. It usually outputs `0`.

You can use the command `echo$?` to reveal the integer returned by the system which will always be `0` unless it’s changed by the programmer using the `return` function. This is how programmers usually return what is right in their codes and where there’s an error.

# Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and removing errors or bugs in a software program or system.

## **`printf` as a debugging tool**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main (void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
    {
        printf ("i is %i", i);
        printf("#\n");
    }
}
```

## **Using debugger**

A program that will allow you to step through your code line by line at your pace. Using your code editor, you can set your pace via the red circle displayed once you move your cursor to the left side of the code. This red circle signifies a break point.

The terminal syntax is - `$ debug50 ./filename`

## **Using rubber duck**

This involves talking through things, sounding out what problems you are having.

# Datatypes and bytes used to represent them

## Memory

| Datatype | Bytes (bits) |
| --- | --- |
| `bool` | 1 byte (8 bits) |
| `int` | 4 bytes (32 bits) |
| `long` | 8 bytes (64 bits) |
| `float` | 4 bytes (32 bits) |
| `double` | 8 bytes (64 bits) |
| `char` | 1 byte (8 bits) |
| `string` | depends (e.g. hi! is 3 bytes) |

## Datatype conversion

The code below will specify an error because you cannot have integer variables and print out a `float`👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int score01 = 70;
    int score02 = 71;
    int score03 = 64;

    printf ("Average: %f\n", (score01 + score02 + score03)/3 );
}
```

One way of fixing this would be to convert at least one of the variables or all three to a `float`👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int score01 = 70;
    int score02 = 71;
    float score03= 64.0;

    printf ("Average: %f\n", (score01 + score02 + score03)/3 );
}
```

OR by converting the divisor to a float 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int score01 = 70;
    int score02 = 71;
    int score03 = 64;

    printf ("Average: %f\n", (score01 + score02 + score03)/3.0 );
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int score01 = 70;
    int score02 = 71;
    int score03= 64;

    printf ("Average: %f\n", (score01 + score02 + score03)/(float) 3.0 );
}
```

This isn’t the best code design though as you will need to write a lot of lines of code. This can be improved by using an array.

# Array examples

In the program below, `int scores[3]` specifies that you are storing three items in your array which consists of integers. The first value is index `[0]`, the second value is `[1]` and the last value is `[2]` which is how you can find/index through any item in the array 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int scores[3] = {70, 71, 64};

    printf ("Average: %f\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2])/(float) 3.0 );
}
```

The example below prints the first item in the array using it’s index 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int scores[3] = {70, 71, 64};

    printf ("%i\n", scores[0]);
}
```

An array can also be written in the format 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int scores[3];
    scores[0] = 70;
    scores[1] = 71;
    scores[2] = 64;

    printf ("%i\n", scores[0]);
}
```

## **Calculating average using loops**

The program below prompts the user for scores three times using a `for` loop, storing each score in an array called `scores`. The average score is then calculated and printed 👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main (void)
{
    int scores[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        scores[i] = get_int ("Score: ");
    }

    printf ("Average: %f\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) /(float)3);
}
```

## Creating a new block for average

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

const int N = 3;

float average (int array[]);
int main (void)
{
    int scores[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        scores[i] = get_int ("Score: ");
    }

    printf ("Average: %.2f\n", (average(scores)));
}
float average (int array[])
{
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        sum = sum + array [i];
    }
    return sum / (float)N;
}
```

In the code above, we first of all assigned a general value to the number `N` in the array for easy modification. We then created a loop to represent the indexes of the arrays i.e. `array[0]`, `array [1]`, `array [2]`. We included a block for average in which the array will be the `input (int array[ ])` and it will output a `float`. We then assigned the value `0` to the variable `sum` and created a loop for the indexes of our scores so as the first index adds, the `sum` keeps increasing. Then the 2nd index adds to the first index which will be the new `sum`. 

## Strings

A **string** is just an array of characters (chars). The data used to store a string varies. When a computer is storing a string it adds  “\0” at the end to specify the end of the string. For example, if you write the word “axe”, it is stored in 4 bytes (3 bytes for axe and 1 byte to indicate the end “\0”). “\0” is called a **nul.**

Characters are also numbers i.e. if you use an `%i` placeholder to view a `char`, the numbers that represent these characters will be displayed👇🏾:

```c
{
    char c[3]={'B','y','e'};
    printf("%i %i %i\n", c[0], c[1], c[2]);
}
```

You can also use the `%c` placeholder to request for the indexes of a string. In the example below, the command returns the character `B`👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main (void)
{
    string  c = "Bye";
    printf("%c\n", c[0]);
}
```

The code below outputs the characters of the name being typed till the end i.e. when the name string isn’t equal to `\0`👇🏾:

```c
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name? ");
    int n = 0;
    while (name[0] != '\0')
    {
        n++;
    }
    printf("%i\n",n);
}
```

Strings also consist of functions e.g. `strlen` in `<string.h>` and `toupper`, `islower` in `<ctype.h>`.

`strlen` is used to find the length of a string. The code below outputs the length of whatever name is typed👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main (void)
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name? ");
    int n = strlen(name);
    printf("%i\n",n);
}
```

The code below makes sure the characters in the string of the users name will transform to uppercase if they are written in lowercase but would still remain uppercase if they are written in uppercase👇🏾:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <string.h>

int main (void)
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name? ");
    printf("After: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(name); i++)
    {
        if (name[i] >= 'a' && name[i] <= 'z')
        {
            printf("%c", name[i] - 32);
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%c", name[i]);
        }
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
