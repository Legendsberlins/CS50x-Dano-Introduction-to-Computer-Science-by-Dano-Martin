# Emoji

# Who produces emojis?

**Emojis** are regulated by a corporation called the **Unicode Consortium** which is a non-profit corporation devoted to developing, maintaining and promoting software internationalization standards and data, particularly the Unicode standard, which specifies the representation of text in all modern software products and standards. They have voting members which include some software and hardware companies like: Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, Adobe, Google, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, SAP, Huawei, Omani Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs.

To get an emoji passed you need to submit a proposal to the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee. These proposal needs to include some factors to support the emoji like:

- Popular demand.
- Multiple usages/meanings.
- Visual distinctiveness, can be recognized.
- Feeling gap, “completeness”.
- Existing vendor compatibility.

Some factors can also put an emoji proposal at a disadvantage:

- Too specific, narrow.
- Redundant.
- Not visually discernable.
- No logos, brands, deities, celebrities.
- Flags. Except it’s recognized by the United Nations (UN) as a countries flag.

The proposal is then passed down to Unicode Technical Committee who vote once a year to pass on proposals. If the proposal is valid, the emoji will be implemented.

# Unicode projects

Unicode has 3 main projects:

- Encoding characters (including emoji) - now over 100,000 assigned.
- Localization resources (Common Locale Data Repository, “CLDR”) E.g. time localization, currency localization based on the geography a device is used from.
- Programming libraries (International Components for Unicode, “ICU”) - they maintain libraries for developers so they do not need to program from scratch.

# How are emojis generated?

Unicode assigns **code points** (a unique number assigned to each Unicode character). For E.g. the ‘tears of joy emoji’ can be written as **U+1F602** with a code point or as **128514** with a decimal or converted to binary as **11111011000000010**. 

As we send emojis from one device to another, we are actually sending numbers which are then converted to the corresponding emoji by our devices.
