# Cybersecurity

# Intro

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.

# Passwords

The most common familiar defense of one‚Äôs data is a **password** which is a relatively weak form of defense.

In 2021, security researchers took a look at data which had been hacked or leaked online by way of public databases. This came about some of the most used as well as the worst passwords according to Nordpass:

1. 123456 - used 103,170,552 times
2. 123456789 - used 46,027,530 times
3. 12345 - used 32,955,431 times
4. qwerty - used 22,317,280 times
5. password - used 20,958,297 times

## Forms of attack

There are different forms of attack. A popular one is **brute-force** which involves an attacker submitting many¬†passwords¬†or¬†passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

### 4-digit passcode

Devices typically use a 4-digit passcode for protection so the question is, how long do you think it might take to crack a 4-digit passcode? To approximate that, you need to know how many 4-digit passcodes are actually possible. There are 10 possibilities (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and for each digit combination we have to put in a 4-digit passcode. Therefore we multiply:

$$
10 * 10 * 10 * 10
$$

This gives 10,000 possibilities.

Therefore, if a hacker guesses a code every second, it will take them 10,000 seconds. Although, someone with a good understanding of programming can automate the process which takes a lot less time. The python code below does this (read the comments to understand) üëáüèæ:

```python
from string import digits #this imports all the possible digits (0-9)
from itertools import product #this combines different digits

for passcode in product(digits, repeat = 4): #loops around different combinations four times
		print(*passcode) #the asterisk formats the passcode possibilities 
```

### 4-letter passcode

This is a bit harder to crack than a 4-digit passcode as it requires 52 possibilities (A-Z -  upper and lower case). Therefore, for a 4-letter passcode, there are 7,311,616 possibilities.

$$
52 * 52 * 52 * 52
$$

The python code below prints all the possibilities üëáüèæ:

```python
from string import ascii_letters #this imports all the possible letters(A-Z & a-z)
from itertools import product #this combines different letters

for passcode in product(ascii_letters, repeat = 4): #loops around different combinations four times
		print(*passcode) #the asterisk formats the passcode posibilities 
```

### 4-characters

This is even harder to crack as it involves letters, numbers, special characters. There are 10 possible digits, 52 possible letters and 32 possible special characters in the English keyboard. This gives $94 * 94 * 94 * 94 = 78,074,896$ possibilities.

The python code below prints all the possibilities üëáüèæ;

```python
from string import ascii_letters, digits, punctuation #this imports all the possible digits characters
from itertools import product #this combines different characters

for passcode in product(ascii_letters + digits + punctuation, repeat = 4): #loops around different combinations four times
		print(*passcode) #the asterisk formats the passcode posibilities 
```

## Two-factor authentication

A **two-factor/multi-factor authentication** is an¬†electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a¬†website or¬†application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an¬†authentication mechanism. 

When signing up to a website with an email, you may be sent a verification code which verifies that the you are in possession of the device which contains the email. With this attackers not only have to brute force but physically have access to your device. This lowers the possibility of an attack.

## Password manager

P**assword managers** are pieces of software that generate, store and manage users passwords. A password manager account can be accessed using biometrics and password. The password needs to be a strong one and the user needs to remember it. If a users password manager account is accessible by an attacker, then all the users passwords in that account are accessible by that attacker. 

# Encryption

**Encryption** enables two people (or computers) to share private information over open networks. Encrypting data means that we scramble the original data to hide the meaning of the text, while still making it possible for the data to be unscrambled using a secret key.

One of the earliest encryption techniques is the¬†**Caesar/rotational Cipher** which was used by Julius Caesar to communicate messages to his allies.

The Caesar Cipher uses substitution which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount. The receiver must know the shift key used by the sender in order to decrypt. The substitution table below shifts each alphabet by 6 but you can shift the alphabets by any integer.

| **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **E** | **F** | **G** | **H** | **I** | **J** | **K** | **L** | **M** | **N** | **O** | **P** | **Q** | **R** | **S** | **T** | **U** | **V** | **W** | **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B | C | D | E | F |

To say ‚ÄúI LOVE YOU‚Äù using the 6-shift table above will be encrypted as:

O RUBK EUA.

## End-to-end encryption

**End-to-end encryption** is a type of encryption that does not involve a middle man. It is just between the sender and the receiver. Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp offer this type of encryption.

## Full-disk encryption

**Full disk encryption** is a technique that encrypts/scrambles all the contents of a disk drive, including the operating system and user data. 

# Ransomware

Attackers can encrypt a users data without giving out the secret key. In the case of **ransomware**, an attacker encrypts user data, blocks accessibility and demands a ransom from the user.

# Incognito mode

Browsers have **incognito/private mode** which keeps data from third parties or attackers. It makes sure the browser does not keep history or any web cookie of a session although, the users history will be known by their ISPs (Internet Service Provider) due to IP routing.
