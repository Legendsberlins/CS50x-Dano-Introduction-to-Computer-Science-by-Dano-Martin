# C

## Intro
**C** is a general-purpose programming language and one of the oldest programming languages. Let's branch other related areas before coming back to programs in C.

## Source Code
A **source code** is a code written by a programmer.

## Machine Code
A **machine code** is a code converted in patterns of 0’s and 1’s that the computer understands. Your source code will be compiled to a machine code via a command.

## Compiler
A **complier** is a program whose job is to make the conversion from source to machine code.

## Terminal Window
A terminal window provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) which is the opposite of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is a means of interacting with a computer program by inputting lines of text called command-lines. `$` indicates a command in a Unix-like OS.
